I use a simple distributed lag econometric model and and daily data from Denmark, which is one of the few places with a long history of signifcant wind power penetration. I show that wind power has the effect of reducing intra-day variability but that this result only partially carries over to price variation over weekly time windows. I suggest that the reduction in price variability in turn is due to a steeper supply schedule at peak-load times </p>\n\n\n        <h4>Executive Summary</h4>\n        \n        <h5>Overview</h5>\n        \n        <p> Wind power is playing an increasingly important role in electricity systems around the world with countries from Great Britain to China planning on massive amounts of investment in the coming decade. The special nature of wind power - negligible marginal costs and an intermittent and variable energy profile - implies that the installation of large amounts of wind energy has the potential to affect the functioning of the electricity system as a whole. Yet the effect that substantial wind capacity has on market-based electricity systems, where prices provide the main mechanism for maintaining a balance of supply and demand is poorly understood in theory, and little researched in practice. </p>\n        \n        <p> Due to the early and heavy investment by Denmark, the Nordic electricity market is one of the few places with a relatively long history with significant amounts of wind power.  The Nordic system is also a market-based system with decentralized producers making bids in the wholesale market on a central exchange.  Prices are the main tool to resolve transmission constraints and balance the system across regions and countries.  These attributes make the Nordic market ideal for studying the effects of wind power.  While other researchers have focused primarily on the effect of wind power on price level, I focus on measures of price variability, and argue that this is an important indicator of how efficiently the electricity system is operating.</p>\n\n        <h5>Methods </h5>\n        <p> In this paper I apply time-series regressions to an extensive dataset of hourly and daily data points from the Danish Transmission System Operator (Energinet), Nordpool - the central exchange, as well as other relevant data sources.  My identifying assumption is that wind power is a passive energy source with marginal costs close to zero.  Wind power can thus be seen to be exogenous as producers have no incentive to adjust production based on price signals.</p>\n\n        <p> I run three sets of regressions each with several different specifications.  I first focus on measures of intraday price volatility – running separate regressions for the effects on the system-wide spot prices as well as the local area prices (Denmark east and west).  In these regressions I must take into account the strong seasonality and serial correlation of power market data.  I then proceed to run regressions where prices are aggregated to daily averages and volatility is evaluated over weekly and monthly time-periods.  </p> \n        \n        <h5>Results</h5>\n        <p> The analysis gives a nuanced view of the effects of wind power on price variability.  When looking at the variability of prices per hour over the course of a day, wind power tends to have the effect of reducing variability.  The effect was significant, both statistically and economically, for the system wide spot price with an estimated elasticity of between -.026 and -.035.  The effect on the Danish area prices tended to be even higher.  The elasticity for Denmark east was estimated to be between -.067 and -.070 and Denmark west to be between -.081 and -.087.</p>\n\n        <p> However, when I aggregate to daily units and look at variability over weekly and monthly periods, wind power has the effect of increasing variability, and more so in the monthly time-window.  For example, the estimated elasticity of wind power on weekly price variability in Denmark west was estimated to be .165 while monthly volatility was estimated to be .200.  Wind power, in other words, seems to be accounting for a significant part of the weekly and monthly price volatility in Denmark. \n           </p> \n\n        <h5> Conclusions</h5>\n        <p> Lower intraday volatility but higher longer-term volatility has implications for investment and system operation.  Given that the lower intraday volatility is due to lower average prices at peak times, this could have adverse effects on investment in peaking generation.  Since the expected payoff of such generation that is only used at peak times is now lower, less may be built.  Thus, though wind power may have the effect of on average reducing intraday variability, in the long term this could lead to more instances of extreme stress and high price spikes when wind is not blowing at peak times. </p>\n\n        <p>The increased volatility at longer time-windows reflects the investment challenges of installing large amounts of intermittent generation.  Consumption has been relatively flat in Denmark over the course of the last two decades.  Therefore the added wind power has tended to replace older thermal generation (mostly coal plants).  These plants are mothballed but often still operational and in times of stress, such as the winter of 2002-2003, they can be activated. In markets where generation must be built to meet growing consumption, substantial backup generation is needed. </p>\n\n        <p> The increased price volatility caused by wind power also has interesting implications for the hydro-power producers that dominate the Nordic market.  The Econ Pøyry groups simulation study for Sweden indicated that the value of water would drop, and thus the profitability of these plants would decrease with increased wind power.  Yet given enough transfer capacity, the increased volatility presents an opportunity for hydro power producers with reservoirs as they can arbitrage the increased price differentials at the same time providing a measure of stability in the system by acting as a “battery”. </p>\n\n    </article>\n\n    <article id=\"hydro\">\n        <h3><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6bCq_4ajKKMeW9Cd3VSNEhrQWc\">Dead Battery?

In particular hydropower can act as a “battery” where large amounts of wind power are installed. In this paper I use simple distributed lag models with data from Denmark and Norway. I find that increased wind power in Denmark causes increased marginal exports to Norway and that this effect is larger during periods of net exports when it is difficult to displace local production. Increased wind power can also be shown to slightly reduce prices in southern Norway in the short-run. Finally, I estimate that as much as 40 percent of wind power produced in Denmark is stored in Norwegian hydropower magazines.</p>\n\n        <h4>Executive Summary</h4>\n\n        <h5> Danish wind power a success because of neighbors’ hydro</h5>\n\n        <p> It is well established in both the economics and engineering literature that hydro power can serve as a backup or battery to large amounts of wind power. Hydro power can quickly and cheaply adjust its production level while storing energy in the form of water in its storage magazines. This paper shows the extent to which this interaction takes place in a market based system where transmission capacity between the wind power area and the hydro power area is limited. I use data from Denmark, which has a large amount of wind power and Norway, which produces nearly all its electricity from hydro power.  Transmission constraints cause wind power to push down prices much more in Denmark than in Norway.  Yet during periods where wind power cannot easily replace local production, 30 to 40 percent of wind power is estimated to be exported and stored in Norwegian hydro power magazines.  While added transmission capacity would likely increase this interaction, this must be weighed against the considerable cost of such investments.</p>\n\n        <p> Power systems need to ensure that electricity production always meets consumption.  The installation of large amounts of wind power where output is volatile must then be offset by plants that can quickly and cheaply adjust their output, such as hydro power. Hydro power plants also have the advantage of being able to store energy in the form of water in reservoirs.  Therefore a reduction in hydro power production due to increased wind power production can be seen as the storage of wind energy.  However, wind power is often not located in the same geographical area as hydro power and it is not clear to what extent a market based system provides the right incentives for this cross-border interaction to occur.  In this paper I estimate the extent to which Danish wind power and Norwegian hydro power are able to interact.  Both countries are integrated in the Nordic electricity market and Denmark has a high share of wind power and essentially no hydro power capacity.  Norway on the other hand is dominated by hydro power.  </p>  \n\n\n\n        <h5> Wind does not easily replace local production on cold days</h5>\n        <p> During certain periods it is difficult for wind power to displace local production. In Denmark, nearly 60 percent of the thermal power plants - coal, biomass, etc. - are combined heat and power plants that provide district heating to homes and businesses. During cold periods, these plants cannot easily be shut off and increased wind production should optimally lead to increased exports to Norway.  In such periods, I estimate that between 30 and 40 percent of Danish wind power production is exported to Norway and stored in Norwegian hydro power magazines through reduced hydro power production.  </p>\n\n\n        <h5> Transmission constraints and prices are important</h5>\n        <p> Both Denmark and Norway are part of the Nordic electricity market and most of the interaction between wind power and hydro power is arranged through market mechanisms. Increased wind power will push down prices which in turn will signal hydro power producers in Norway to reduce production and allow for increased imports from Denmark. However,transmission capacity between the two countries is limited. Therefore, increased wind power will tend to reduce prices more in Denmark than in Norway.  I estimate that a doubling of wind power will on average reduce prices by between 3 and 5 percent in Denmark but only by .5 percent in Norway.  Adding more transmission capacity will reduce this price difference and lead to a higher incentive for hydro power producers to reduce their production in response to increased wind power. However, transmission cables and other infrastructure are expensive and the benefits of more interaction must be weighed against these costs.  </p>\n\n\n    </article>\n\n    <article id=\"scrapping\"> \n        <h3><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMVFhBY1lwZ2xydXc/edit?usp=sharing\">The Decision to Scrap a Wind Turbine: Policy changes, scrapping incentives and why windturbines in good locations get scrapped first</a></h3>\n        <h4>The Energy Journal, Vol. 35, No. 2. 2014</h4>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6bCq_4ajKKMSkpUYzVPWE0zR1U\">Data</a></h4>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6bCq_4ajKKMWV8xNWRuMWRDdkk\">R Code</a></h4>\n        <h4>Abstract</h4>\n        <p class=\"abstract\">The most common reason for scrapping a wind turbine in Denmark is to make room for a newer turbine. The decision to scrap a wind turbine is then highly dependent on an opportunity cost that comes from the interaction of scarce land resources, technological change and changes in subsidy policy. Using a Cox regression model I show that turbines that are located in areas with better wind resources are at a higher risk of being scrapped. Policies put in place in order to encourage the scrapping of older, poorly placed turbines actually have a larger effect on well- placed turbines.</p>\n\n        <h4>Executive Summary </h4>\n        <p> Previous studies have shown that only a minority of wind turbines get scrapped because of mechanical defect or wear.  In this way, wind turbines are more like computers than cars – turbines are usually scrapped in order to make room for newer, larger, more technologically advanced models. The lifetime of a turbine is then not primarily a function of mechanical quality but is dependent on a combination of technological change, subsidy policy and the wind resources of a turbine’s location. The research has implications for the designing and implementation of wind power subsidies.</p>\n\n        <p>A data set consisting of all wind turbines constructed in Denmark from 1972 through July of 2012 is used in the study. I show that the timing of scrapping is strongly affected by changes in wind power subsidy policy as well as by policies meant to encourage the scrapping of older turbines. The key finding is that turbines located in better, windier locations get scrapped first.  </p>\n\n        <h5>Reductions in subsidy cause scrappings </h5>\n\n        <p>Reductions in wind power subsidies have led to jumps in the number of scrappings as the figure below shows. The reason is that turbine owners receive subsidies for a defined lifetime of their turbine based on when they were installed. When a reduction in subsidies was announced, owners rushed to install new, larger turbines before the lower subsidy policy took effect.  Because zoning and preparing new land for turbines take time, many wind power producers instead scrapped older turbines to make room for the newer turbines.  \n         </p>\n         <p>In the figure the dotted vertical lines represent times when subsidies were lowered and the jumps in scrappings are visible before the policy changes at the beginning of 2000 and especially 2003. The shaded region shows periods in which a subsidy was available for owners who scrapped older, smaller turbines. These policies are also shown to have been highly effective. </p>\n        \n        <p><img src=\"scrappings.png\"></p>\n        <h5>Turbines in good locations get scrapped first</h5>\n\n        <p>The main result of the research is to show that as turbine owners rushed to install new turbines before the production subsidy was lowered or to take advantage of the scrapping subsidy, they tended to scrap turbines located in better, windier locations first. This is because in the face of technological change that has led to the ability to make larger more productive turbines over time, older turbines located in windier locations represent a higher opportunity cost. </p> \n\n        <p>The findings have implications for the designing and timing of wind power subsidies. The research suggests, for example, that if the goal of policy is to maximize the amount of wind power, changes in policy should be announced well in advance so that producers have time to prepare new land for the installation of a new turbine rather than scrapping an old one.  </p>\n\n    </article>\n\n    <article id=\"elbas\">\n        <h3><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMVXlCb1JsbWNnVFU/edit?usp=sharing\">Now or Later?

Several simulation studies have pointed to the advantages of trading closer to the time of delivery when large amounts of intermittent power are installed in an electricity system. Using two years of hourly data from Denmark and a simple linear probability model as well as a non-parametric technique, I show that an unexpected relationship exists between shortfalls and surpluses of wind power generation and the probability of trade on the Nordic hour-ahead market, Elbas. Shortfalls increase the probability of trade but surpluses are actually shown to decrease the probability of trade. This result is explained by Danish wind power policies that unintentionally discourages trading on short term markets and in turn likely results in unnecessarily high balancing costs.</p>\n\n        <h4>Executive Summary</h4>\n        <h5> Short-term markets can save balancing costs with lots of wind power installed, if subsidies don’t get in the way</h5>\n\n\n        <p> In the Nordic electricity market, along with several other markets around the world, much of the trade is organised a day ahead of delivery.  But this can be problematic when large amounts of wind power are installed.  The reason of course is that wind power can only be forecasted approximately and the predictions tend to get better closer to the time of delivery.  The ability to trade on short-term markets should be advantageous in electricity systems with large amount of wind power.</p>\n\n        <p> Simulation studies have shown that trading closer to real time can save substantial amounts in balancing costs, yet little empirical work on the relationship between short-term trading and intermittent generation exists.   Using Danish data I provide evidence that short-term markets, like the Nordic hour-ahead market Elbas, can serve a useful role in dealing with wind power forecasting errors.  However I also show how subsidies and regulations can inadvertently get in the way of this market mechanism.  </p>\n\n        <p> Figure 1 shows the expected relationship between wind power forecasting errors and the probability of trade on Elbas.  Both positive and negative forecasting errors should lead to an increased probability of trade on the market.  A producer with a shortfall of wind electricity will be more likely to go on the Elbas market to make up for the deficit in order to avoid added balancing costs.  Likewise a producer with more wind power than they bid in the day-ahead market will wish to sell their surplus electricity.    </p>  \n\n        <p><img src=\"expected_relationship.png\" alt=\"expected relationship\"></p>\n\n        <h5> Wind power subsidies likely lead to higher balancing costs</h5>\n\n        <p>An analysis of data between 2010 and 2012 however shows an unexpected result.  While shortfalls in wind power do indeed lead to a higher probability of trade on the short-term Elbas market, the opposite is the case for surpluses, as can be seen in Figure 2.  </p>\n        <p><img src=\" actual_relationship.png\" alt=\"actual relationship\"></p>\n\n        <p> A likely explanation for this pattern is that Danish wind power owners can take advantage of a purchase guarantee that was part of a subsidy package that was phased out for turbines built after 2003.  In other words turbine owners covered by the subsidy are guaranteed the day-ahead price plus subsidy for their wind power irrespective of what they had bid on the day-ahead market.  In turn, they have little incentive to use the short-term markets when they have excess wind power production.  </p>\n\n        <p>This explanation has a testable implication.  A large jump in installations happened prior to the subsidy change in 2003, and more so, the purchase obligation expires after 10 years.  We would then expect that the relationship between positive forecast errors and trade on the Elbas market to change around 2013 as a large portion of the turbines lose the subsidy.  Updating the data and re-running the regressions for a set of rolling windows shows that as more data from late 2012 and 2013 is included, surpluses of wind power begin to increase rather than decrease the probability of trade on Elbas, as initially expected.   </p>\n\n        <p>This research shows clear evidence that short-term markets can reduce the balancing costs associated with the introduction of large amounts of wind power.  However, care must be taken so that subsidies that often accompany the introduction of such energy sources do not obstruct the incentives to use these short-term markets.  </p>\n\n    </article>\n\n\n    <article id=\"price_spikes\">\n        <h3><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMQmpPNWlqN014Y0k/edit?usp=sharing\">How electricity price spikes can help overcome the energy efficiency gap.</a> </h3>\n        <h4>Econonomics Letters, Forthcoming</h4>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMREc2Q3BWLUlrRWc/edit?usp=sharing\">Data</a></h4>\n        <h4><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMclEzOEJycnhQRU0/edit?usp=sharing\">R Code</a></h4>\n        <h4>Abstract</h4>\n        <p class=\"abstract\">Studies have shown that many consumers and businesses fail to invest in energy efficiency improvements despite seemingly ample financial incentives to do so – the so-called energy efficiency gap. Attempts to explain this gap often focus on searching costs, information frictions and behavioral factors. Using data on Norwegian electricity prices and Google searches for heat pumps, I suggest that the inherently spikey nature of many deregulated electricity markets – often seen as a sign of inefficiency– has a strong and significant positive effect on searching for information on energy efficiency goods. I attempt to identify the informational/behavioral effect by using a novel method of measuring spikiness: decomposing the price series into a range of Loess smoothed series and deviations from these curves.</p>\n\n    <h4>Executive Summary</h4>   \n<p>An important and often contentious issue in energy market research has been what has been referred to as the energy efficiency gap.  This is the phenomenon that both consumers and businesses do not seem to invest in energy efficiency despite seemingly ample returns to do so.  Much of the recent litterature on the subject has focused on informational and behavioral factors.  Information on energy efficiency may not be provided in optimal quantities since it has public-good qualities.  In addition, behavioral factors may come into play.  Even if a person has sufficient information on electricity prices and the availability of energy efficiency goods, the effort of calculating out costs and benefits requires attention and mental exertion.</p>\n\n<p>This article attempts to connect the energy efficiency literature, especially its focus on information frictions and behavioral considerations, to characteristics of deregulated electricity market.  In particular I argue that the tendency of deregulated electricity markets to experience occasional price spikes and high short-term volatility may have a silver lining.  When price spikes happen, they can generate news coverage in newspapers, radio and television, providing information on electricity prices as well as a behavioral nudge to search for information on energy efficiency goods.  </p>\n\n<p>Searching costs and other informational frictions have been an active area of theoretical research in economics, however empirical work has been limited due to the difficulty of directly measuring these phenonomen.  However, the widespread adoption of internet search engines has made observing searching behavior possible.  I use data from Google, the leading search engine in Europe and North America, to study the relationship between electricity market price spikes and searches for energy efficiency goods. </p> \n\n<p>I use the case of Norwegian wholesale electricity prices and searches for electric heat pumps.  In Norway, heating is the largest single use of electricity by households. In turn, one of the most significant energy efficiency improvements a household can make is to switch from electric panel heaters to more efficient electric heat pumps.</p>  \n\n<p>A challenge is how to define price-spikes as opposed to normal price variation.  I side-step this issue by creating measures of a range of “spikiness.”  I take the difference between the actual price series and a smoothed series where the fit is varied. Spikiness is measured, on the one extreme, as brief deviations from a closely fitted curve to, at the other extreme, all deviations from an overall quadratic trend line.</p>  \n \n<p>I run regressions of searches for heat pumps on the range of the price-spike series.  I control for weather as well as hydropower conditions.  I also include a measure of smoothed prices that proxies for the actual price effect as most consumers pay retail prices that are based on monthly averages of wholesale prices.  I find large positive and significant effects of positive price spikes for the full range of “spikiness.”  Results are especially large at the narrowest definition of price spikes – representing large and short-lived price spikes that can be shown to generate the most media attention.</p>  \n\n    </article>\n\n    <article id=\"market_power\">\n        <h3><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMYU1pdnNqaXJoT3M/edit?usp=sharing\">Real-time versus day-ahead market power in a hydro-based electricity market.

I find no significant evidence of a concurrent reaction of field production to oil prices, though a slight lagged effect is found of the magnitude of approximately 2 to 4\\% for a 10 dollar per barrel increase in the real price of oil.  Most of this effect appears to come in the planning phase of a field's development.</p>\n\n        <h4>Executive Summary</h4>\n        <p class = \"executive summary\"> \n<p>For most of the last century, crude oil has been the world's single most important and valuable fuel source. Naturally, questions of how the oil price affects the world economy as well as how oil production reacts to the oil price have been fundamental topics in economics. However, given the importance of the topic, surprisingly little is known about how production reacts to the oil price at the field level. The few field-level studies that do exist, look at onshore fields. However, challenging offshore fields, which make up an increasing share of world oil production, are substantially different in character. </p>\n\n<p>This gap in the literature can partly be explained by a dearth of detailed field level data. Another roadblock is the highly non-linear nature of the production data that results from the engineering and geo-physical forces involved in production from offshore wells.  This data is not well modeled by standard linear econometric tools. </p>\n\n<p>In this article I use detailed field-level data from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. To control for the non-linear production profile I use a semi-parametric model within the Generalized Additive Model frameworks. At a basic conceptual level, I use a smoothed function to control for the bell-shaped production curve that is common to most of the oil fields, using the remaining variation to estimate the coefficients on the concurrent oil price and its lags. \n</p>\n\n<p>While a simple hotelling model would indicate that changes in oil prices should lead producers to dynamically optimize the timing of extraction, and in turn immediately alter production, my main results indicate that oil prices have no significant concurrent effect on oil production. A slight lagged effect is estimated at lags of between 1 to 4 years. </p>\n\n<p>These results are consistent with an understanding of the offshore petroleum industry as having extremely high fixed and operating costs. Maintaining spare capacity in order to react to changes in the oil price is likely prohibitively expensive. Instead, increases in the oil price lead to more investment, which has an effect on production with a significant lag.</p>\n\n<p>The findings in this paper can provide some guidance on the effects of the recent steep fall in the oil price on Norwegian production, as well as production from other offshore areas. The results indicate that the recent fall in prices is unlikely to have major ramifications for production in existing fields.  Anecdotal evidence however suggests that searching and exploration are being curtailed, thus the effects on total future production could be significant by way of fewer new field developments.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, the modest estimated effect of prices on production adds weight to the argument of James Hamilton that most of the increased supply of oil that comes from higher prices is from expanding the geographic and technological boundaries of oil production.  For example exploration of deep-water oil deposits off the coast of Brazil and extraction of oil sands in western Canada.</p>\n    </p>\n     \n    </article>\n\n    <article id=\"solar_lemons\">\n    <h3><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6bCq_4ajKKMdUFDei13azBrOUU/view?usp=sharing\">What's behind the surge in the California rooftop solar market?

But the role of local contractors and their evolving business models were likely equally important, in large part because they facilitated overcoming uncertainty and information asymmetries. \n    </p>\n\n<h4>Executive Summary</h4>\n\n<p>In the wake of the world-wide financial crisis that began in 2008, the Chinese government initiated a large economic stimulus package. One of the side-goals of this package was to turn China into a top producer and exporter of solar panels. New and existing Chinese manufacturers of solar panels were provided inexpensive loans and other forms of subsidy in order to substantially build-out capacity. Within a few years, Chinese solar power manufacturers were beginning to export panels at prices significantly lower than established manufacturers based in Europe, Japan and the US.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotes abound about the role of Chinese panels in driving the boom in installations of photovoltaic systems in California and elsewhere. Though to my knowledge little formal research on the topic exists in the literature. </p>\n\n<p>I use a large sample of approximately 125,000 rooftop solar power installations in California between 2007 and 2014. Using simple single and multi-level regression models and other descriptive evidence, I show that the introduction of Chinese panels did help substantially lower prices overall and played a significant role in expanding the market. But I also show that cheaper panels from China did not in isolation drive the expansion of the market. The decisions and evolving strategies of local contractors was an interrelated and equally important factor.</p>\n\n<p>The economics of solar power are unique within power generation in that assets are often owned by individual consumers and small businesses. Large energy companies have considerable expertise in generation technologies and engineering, investment risk, electricity market structure and other specialized knowledge and competencies involved in generating electricity. A consumer or small business, on the other hand, can be expected to have much more limited knowledge and expertise.</p> \n\n<p>I argue that the expansion of the California rooftop solar market was driven by a combination of cheaper panels - primarily from Chinese suppliers - and evolving business strategies of local contractors. In particular, several large solar system contractors adopted a leasing business model. With a leased solar system, homeowners do not own the solar systems that are placed on their roofs and do not usually need to provide the initial capital for the system, but instead are offered electricity from the panels at prices lower than that of electricity from the grid over a defined period - often 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>Leasing models are attractive to consumers and businesses for several reasons. They provide cash-constrained homeowners and small businesses the ability to place solar power systems on their roofs without a large initial expenditure that may require obtaining financing. A leased solar power system can allay both uncertainty about the complexities of owning and maintaining a solar panel system as well as informational asymmetry about the quality of the installation done by the contractor.</p>\n\n<p>The data shows a strong correlation between contractors that introduced a leasing model and those that switched to using Chinese panels. This is particularly true of the contractors that gained the most market share. It is likely that cheaper Chinese panels allowed for such leasing models to be financially feasible for the contractors to offer. In turn, the advantages of being able to offer a leasing model allowed contractors to gain market share.</p>\n\n<p>To take the analysis further, I use a multilevel regression model that directly models the fall in system prices on contractor-level decisions about switching to Chinese panels and a leasing model. I find that companies that switched both to using a leasing model and Chinese panels saw a significantly steeper drop in their costs than firms that sold solar power systems out-right with panels supplied from established firms.</p>\n\n<p>In the discussion of the results, I also suggest that the observed correlation between contractors that install Chinese panels and use a leasing model may have a second, more subtle economic explanation. The introduction of a leasing model may have helped overcome an asymmetric information problem relating to the uncertain quality of Chinese produced solar panels.</p>\n\n<p>Solar panel systems are significant investments for households and businesses that need to last well over a decade in order to be financially profitable even with significant subsidies. At the same time, individual homeowners or small contractors would incur great costs in verifying the quality of the main component of a solar power system: the solar panels. In this way the market for Chinese solar panels might resemble Akerlof's market for ``lemons''. I discuss this possibility and give some anecdotal evidence in support of it. Though unfortunately, limitations of the data preclude any strong empirical test of its presence in the market.</p>\n   \n    </article>\n\n</section>\n\n\n<section id=\"resources\">\n    <h2></h2>\n    <ul> \n        <li><h3>Resources for Data, Programming and Statistics</a></h3></li>          \n        <li><a href=\"python_resources.html\">Python programming</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"r_resources.html\">R programming and analysis</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"data_resources.html\">Data sources (mostly energy)</li>\n    </ul>\n\n</section>\n<!-- \n <section id=\"blog\">\n    <h2></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#koeprising\">Køpring skal gjøre vondt</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#review_second_machine_age\">Review of The Second Machine Age</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#review_the_innovators\">Review of The Innovators</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#tragedy_of_london_transit\">The Tragedy of London Transit</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#why_nations_fail\">Review of Why Nations Fail</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#oil_and_ecars\">The attractiveness of electric cars has little to do with the price of oil</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#derfor_faller_oljeprisen\">Derfor faller oljeprisen</a></h3></li>\n\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#klimaforsikring\">Billig klimaforsikring</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#sense_of_style\">Review of A Sense of Style</a></h3></li>\n\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#hacking_bayes\">Review of Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a></h3></li>\n\n<li><h3><a href=\"blog_posts.html#solar_dumping\">Solar dumping</a></h3></li>\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#utilities_model\">The Innovators Dillemma and the Utilities Model</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#budapest\">Budapest</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#hoyhus\">Mytene om høyhus</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#fast_trains\">Fast trains</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#shanghai\">Shanghai</a> </h3></li>\n\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#china_energy\">China's coal problem and promise</a> </h3></li>\n\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#getting_around_beijing\">Getting around Beijing</a> </h3></li>\n\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#beijing_first_impressions\">Beijing, first impressions</a> </h3></li>\n\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#thinkbayes_review\">Review of think bayes</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#sykkelpartiethoyre\">Sykkelpartiet Høyre</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#china_coal_to_gas\">China coal-to-gas unlikely to blow up climate</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#my_crappy_teaching\">My crappy teaching, and what I have learned from it</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#oil_price_blog\">For Norwegian off-shore, oil prices don't matter (much)</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#horses\">Horses, humans and cars in NYC</a> </h3></li>\n\n<li><h3> <a href=\"blog_posts.html#efficiency_stuff\">Is More (Stuff) Better?

The puppies are, in turn, a strong signal that this is not a book meant for the hardcore mathematician and statistician looking for a rigorous guide to Bayesian statistical theory. \n\nThis is a book for your run-of-the-mill applied researcher who has heard about Bayesian analysis and statistics, and would like to learn more about it and, importantly, how to do it. The book serves this purpose well. It provides the basic formula and concepts of Bayesian analysis, and then provides plenty of detailed explanation, examples and code in how to do a range of analysis. \n\nAs far as mathematics texts go - the book is chatty. Among technical types, this is not always a compliment. But I liked the long discussions that explained - in words - the logic of the models and results. For me, being able to explain, intuitively and in plain english, is an important part of a feeling of understanding mathematics. In that way, I felt reading through this book helped to clarify a lot of concepts that I was aware of from before, but that had felt somewhat vague.  \n\nThis “chatty” style is especially important for Bayesian analysis because it reveals one of the main strengths of Bayes methods - their intuitive appeal. Bayesian methods approaches probability and uncertainty in a way that is natural and intuitive to how many people think of those concepts. In the frequentist tradition, the goal is to estimate some theoretical “true” parameter value, where uncertainty is represented as the randomness that comes from repeated draws. In Bayesian analysis, the parameters are themselves uncertain, and the goal is to estimate an appropriate distribution for those parameters.  \n\nCompared to other texts and tutorials on Bayesian analysis that I have read, Doing Bayes unapologetically focuses on teaching modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation tools rather than spending much time on solving explicit analytic solutions or using grid approximations. While there may be some trade-off in getting a mathematically deep understanding of Bayesian methods, the book clearly is focused on those wishing to do Bayesian analysis, rather than understanding the minutia of the underlying theory. The flexibility and relative ease-of-use of simulation methods make it a natural focus point. \n\nKruschke uses R and the Bayesian simulation language JAGS for most of the examples, but also provides some instruction for using the newer STAN. By a lot of accounts, STAN is on the cutting edge, and in some ways is also easier to use than JAGS. Therefor in the examples I tried to work out, I focused on using STAN - which has a solid and easy to follow reference manual. STAN is new and still under development, so I understand why the author chose to use the more stable JAGS, but I would imagine that a second edition will move in the direction of using STAN. \n\nDoing Bayes is also not shy about boasting of the advantages of Bayesian analysis over typical frequentist hypothesis testing methods. A lot of this was good - and the book includes some of the best explanations and motivations for using Bayesian analysis that I have read. \n\nYet Kruschke seems also a bit too quick to overlook the advantages of approximation methods based on a frequentist viewpoint. Andrew Gelman - also a strong proponent of Bayesian methods - recommends, for example, using the quick and efficient approximation methods for hierarchical models to zero-in on an appropriate specification before putting together a fully Bayesian model - which can be more time consuming to both set-up and execute. \n\nMore so, though plenty of examples exist of a Bayesian analysis giving different and potentially better answers than estimation by, say, maximum likelihood, in most situations the answers the different methods give will be similar. Bayesian analysis has some strong advantages over traditional frequentist tools, but the best advice still seems to be: use the methods that best solve the problem.  \n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"falling_oil_prices\">\n<h3>Falling oil prices don't hurt renewables, they help them</h3>\n<h3>May 29th, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>On friday I was at a small workshop at the University of Aberdeen about petroleum economics. Once again I heard someone state - as if it was plainly obvious - that the fall in oil prices would hurt surging renewables. It won’t. If anything it will help.</p>  \n\n<p>First of all, oil and renewables generally do not compete, and when they do, renewables are so dominant that even a price fall of 50% is irrelevant. Long ago, most parts of the world stopped producing electricity by burning oil. After the energy crisis of the late 1970’s and 1980’s, using oil to create electricity was seen as too expensive and too risky - especially when abundant gas and coal could be found closer to home. Oil has essentially become a one-trick pony - transportation.</p> \n\n<p>A few places still use oil to generate electricity. Hawaii has had little choice but to rely on oil to generate a big part of its electricity, that is, until solar power became cheap. Hawaii now aims to have 40 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent renewables by 2050. This is not purely out of concern for the environment - they will save huge amounts by not relying on imported oil - even at 50 dollars a barrel. </p>\n\n<p>A recent corporate event here in Norway drives home why the drop in oil prices may even help renewables. Statoil - the partly state owned oil giant - has been going through a bit of a crisis with the fall in the oil price. Investments in expensive canadian oil sands, arctic drilling, and other challenging deep water regions have suddenly become huge money pits (or better yet, money wells). One significant, but under reported change in the corporate structure was the establishment of a new renewables division that would directly report to the CEO. </p> \n\n<p>Statoil isn’t new to renewables, but the division was, quite literally, a part of the marketing division. Internally it was seen as a way to market Statoil as a clean company. The fact was, when the price of oil was at over 100 dollars a barrel, the most profitable area for a company like Statoil to deploy their capital was towards finding more oil. Renewables were toys and marketing gimmics.</p> \n\n<p>However, with oil prices at close to half of their recent highs, that is not nearly as true as it was before. Suddenly, the profitability of deploying capital towards finding more oil is not much more than deploying it to build offshore wind turbines. And this, apparently, is exactly what Statoil intends to do. Already they are involved in several major offshore wind projects in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Now it looks like Statoil will pick up the pace of such investments. This will likely continue to be centered around the UK, where subsidies are the highest. But the costs of off-shore wind power have been coming down quickly, with cost declines of <a href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2015/02/26/government-renewables-subsidies-show-costs-declining/\">more than 30 percent being reported between first- and second-generation projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Statoil is not the only company with capital to deploy. Total is perhaps the oil company that has taken the threats and opportunities of renewable energy most seriously. They acquired the solar panel maker and developer SunPower already in 2011 - one of the largest and most efficient in the industry. The fall in oil prices only encourages oil companies like Total to use their capital outside of their core oil searching business.</p>\n\n<p>Petrol states in the mideast are also in the process of shifting where they deploy their capital. In Saudi Arabia nearly 25% percent of their oil production is gobbled up by their own consumption - much of it in inefficient and expensive oil-fired power generators. No wonder the government has set lofty goals for getting a large share of their electricity from solar power.</p>\n\n<p>For the last few decades, oil has been good business. Buyers - especially fast growing industrializing nations like China - seemed to be eager to consume ever more, even at sky high prices. Consumers also appeared to have few alternatives. That is changing - technology on both the production and consuming side has made oil much less valuable. Oil companies - sitting on huge amounts of physical, financial and human capital - are beginning to look for places to profitably deploy this capital outside their core business. The maturity of the renewables industry has perhaps hit a major milestone when even the oil companies are becoming eager investors. \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"review_of_econ_quant\">\n<h3>Review of John Stachurski's <a href=\"http://quant-econ.net\">Quantitative Economics</a> </h3>\n<h3>May 22nd, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>First, an admission: I am an econ graduate school drop-out. I started in a PhD program in Economics at the University of Washington. But after the first year of heavy coursework that seemed to drain me of all the joy of learning, I decided to drop out. I hung on for a year more - getting a masters degree as a consolation prize, then moving to Norway (so dramatic!) and starting a PhD in Management Science - basically the applied mathematics division of a business school. I ended up enjoying this, finished a PhD, and now I am for the most part a happy post-doc doing fun things. </p>\n\n<p>The most relevant part of this story was in the third sentence: econ graduate school wasn't fun - nor was it meant to be. Lectures, homeworks, and tests focused on memorizing a lot of information and mathematical derivation and then regurgitating. Understanding, learning, and a sense of creation came a distant second, if at all.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, what surprises me most about my experience in graduate school well into the age of the computer (this was 2006 - 2008) was that we barely touched one. In a few of the econometrics courses, we toyed around with some datasets. But theory courses - which made up most of the coursework - were strictly pen and paper. \n</p>\n\n<p>This is where the online course Quantitative Economics - quant-econ.net - by John Stachurski comes in (Officially, the course is listed as being co-created by the economist big-shot Thomas Sargent, but Stachurski seems to have done most of the work). A practical, readable, hands-on guide to doing modern numerical simulations in Economics. It is the course I wish I had when I was a graduate student.\n</p>\n\n <p>The course starts out with a choice: Python or Julia - two modern, open-source programming languages; the former being more general and well-developed, the latter being explicitly designed to be used for scientific computing, but is still developing. A great start, as most Economists seems to be way behind on the prevailing open-source computation trends, with most relying on the commercial software that is expensive and limited like MatLab.\n </p>\n\n <p>I plumped for the Python version of the lectures since I knew the language from before and I like its flexibility. The lectures began with a solid introduction to python. I have worked through a few other tutorials and books on python, but I actually found this to be one of the better ones. I learned a lot of practical tricks, like how to manually read in messy data from a file.  \n </p>\n\n <p>After the first few chapters providing a solid grounding in general computation and programming in Python, there comes two sections of applications. In the first introductory section a fairly broad spectre of topics are introduced: markov processes, dynamic programming, state-space models and the kalman filter. Some of these I knew ahead of time, some I had heard of but only had a vague sense of what was going on. But working through the examples and problems was a great way of getting a good intuition for how they work. The magic of learning by programming is that it is relatively easy to take the worked example, and apply it with some of your own tweaks and applications. Compared to a book and a pen and paper approach, the distance between doing a problem and being on the research frontier is small. \n </p>\n\n<p> I spent quite a lot of time working through the first two sections of the book, but I skipped the third section: advanced applications. My main interests are as a statistician and empiricist, and diving into these more complex and time consuming models is probably mainly for those interested in writing papers directly using those methods. But that is the beauty of self-study - you can decide yourself when you want to quit. </p> \n\n<p> In the end, dabling a few hours every day for a few months on econ-quant.net seemed to give a better starting point for actually doing research in quantitative economics than any single course I took in graduate school. Even for non-economists, the course is a good introduction to computational tools used in many fields. If I have one complaint, it is that little effort is made to give intuition behind some of the economic models that are presented. Since this course is focused on computation, that may not be that surprising. But this course has not lessened my suspicion of mathematically elegant economic theories with little real-world intuition.  \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"koeprising\">\n<h3>Køprising skal gjøre vondt</h3>\n<h3>April 27th, 2015</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.e-pages.dk/bergenstidende/1809/article/264899/28/2/render/?token=02cd272aa0579373983f0bf8c4cee611\">Fra Bergens Tidende, 27. April</a></p>\n\n<p>I januar neste år skal Bergen innføre køprising eller tidsdifferensierte bompenger, som det egentlig heter. Både privatpersoner og bedrifter har klaget over at dette kommer til å gjøre vondt. Men det er hele poenget.</p>\n\n<p>Endret atferd, som for eksempel at bedrifter velger å flytte og at privatpersoner bestemmer seg for å bytte fra bil til buss selv om det er upraktisk, er akkurat grunnen for at køprising er så effektivt. Men vellykket politikk må til en viss grad være rettferdig. Kommunen, fylket og staten må nå gjøre en ekstra innsats for å sikre at gode alternativer eksisterer for alle i Bergen.</p>\n\n<p>Om man skal bygge på erfaringer fra andre byer, så kommer køprising til å ha en betydelig effekt på både køene og den totale mengden biltrafikk gjennom sentrum. London innførte en form for køprising i 2003 og har siden økt avgiften til omtrent 130 kroner for å kjøre inn i bykjernen i rushtiden. Dette har ført til 30 prosent mindre trafikk i bykjernen. Stockholm har en mye mindre avgift, men erfarte også en nedgang på nesten 30 prosent i trafikk. Køprising fungerer.</p>\n\n<p>Men hvis man går rundt i gatene i London, legger man fort merke til at byen fortsatt er dominert av biler. I noen av byens (og verdens) dyreste områder, er det flust med gateparkering. De parkerte bilene er nesten alltid dyre luksusmerker, vanlige folk har stort sett ikke råd til å ha bil i London. Gågater er vanskelig å finne og sykkelfeltene må være noen av verdens smaleste.</p>\n\n<p>Imidlertid har de i Stockholm fokusert mer på å gjøre om gateareal til gående og syklende. Stockholm er ofte kåret til en av verdens beste byer til å gå i. Byen har også investert mye i tog og T-bane nettet, og selv bybane har blitt foreslått.</p>\n\n<p>Når Bergen innfører køprising kommer det til å føre til bedre kapasitet på veiene. Dette bør følges med en rettferdig fordeling av den ledige kapasiteten. Busser burde få egne felt på flere av hovedveiene, og flere av Bergen sentrums smale, sjarmerende gater burde bli forbeholdt gående og syklister. Og, ja, Bybanen burde utvides, over bakken, til Åsane og Fyllingsdalen. Dette er noe alle kan få glede av, ikke bare de som har råd til å betale avgiften.</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"review_second_machine_age\">\n<h3>Review of The Second Machine Age</h3>\n<h3>March 24th, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>As part of my recent reading binge on tech-related books, I just finished reading The Second Machine Age, written by two economists: Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.  I started reading this immediately after finishing The Innovators - and this book touches on a lot of the same themes of technological advance.  They even land on similar conclusions: the future belongs to those that can harness the power of the computer.  But unlike the optimism of The Innovators, the authors of The Second Machine Age worry more about the economic effects of seemingly accelerating technological advance on economic inequality and even societal stability.  It is in addressing some of these worries that I think this otherwise thoughtful book comes up a bit short. </p> \n\n<p>The authors of the book are clearly in wonder and awe of emerging technology.  They describe how computers are increasingly getting competent at activities thought - just a few years - to be the sole domain of humans. They describe the wonders of Google´s self-driving cars and how IBM´s Watson can parse the subtelities of the game show Jeapardy.  It is here - in describing these new technologies and their potential, that the authors are at their most engaging.  \n</p>\n\n<p>While laying out a strong case for technological and, in turn, productivity optimism, the authors have a more uncertain and pessimistic view of the effects on the wider economy and especially inequality.  Computers are increasingly able to do the jobs of typically middle-class professionals like accountants, administrators and even financial analysts.  More so, digitization can create a winner-takes-all economy: everyone downloading the latest album from the superstar rather than going out to the local jazz-club.  \n</p>\n<p>The authors attempt to suggest policies and solutions to the problems that technology could bring, but it is here where I find the book most lacking.  It wasn’t that their policy prescriptions were bad, but rather that they were conventional and could have been taken out of any introductory economics course. The authors seem to be arguing in the book that technology will revolutionize the economy, but that has no effect on economic policy.  This seems wrong to me. \n</p>\n<p>For example, the authors advocate the negative income tax, effectively a way of subsidising low-wage work. Economists from both the left and the right think it is a good idea and Richard Nixon even tried to get one passed.  But the solution has languished politically for decades.  A more straightforward suggestion might be to increase the minimum wage.  The standard economic argument against this is that it will lead to higher unemployment.   But in the world with soaring productivity due to technological progress, the negative effect that a higher minimum wage would have on employment  would seem modest.  Countries like Norway, Denmark and Germany - all with high minimum wages and low unemployment - seem to support this view.  \n</p>\n<p>I think the book could also have speculated more on dynamics and trends that go hand-in-hand with increased technological progress.  An important one is urbanisation.  The industrial revolution led to an initial large-scale urbanisation.  The car and post-war manufacturing boom led to suburbanisation and spreading cities, often with hollow cores.  \n</p>\n<p>The information age seems to be leading to a new round of dense urbanisation.  This trend has many implications for the economy and jobs.  City-dwellers tend to be much larger consumers of services - going out for coffee, getting a taxi, ordering take-out and sending out laundry.  Many of these services are hard to farm out to machines.  Coffee vending machines have been around for decades - but there are more baristas and more coffee shops now than any time before.  \n</p>\n<p>An important part of the solution of dealing with the negative effects of technological change is then to help promote the health of cities.  Policies that encourage building and density in cities, would be an important contribution.  Height regulations and overly burdensome preservation regimes often have the effect of squeezing out many potential urban-dwellers by leading to skyrocketing prices. London and Paris are two of the worst sinners here. Policies to make urban living more attractive could also help - like reducing pollution and car traffic. Too many cities are places to drive in and out of, rather than to live in.  \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"review_the_innovators\">\n<h3>Review of The Innovators</h3>\n<h3>March 15th, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>I recently finished reading the The Innovators, by Walter Isaachsen - and I really liked it.  The book can be described as a series of biographical sketches of the dozens of figures who had partial responsibility for bring about the digital age - from Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace and their mechanical computer in the 1800’s to the founders of Google.  Isaachsen does a good job of teasing out the strong personalities of these innovators, but he also manages to use a few themes to draw the book together.  First and foremost, Isaachsen stresses the importance of collaboration in essentially all important innovations - dispelling the myth of the lone genius.</p>  \n\n<p>Almost all the biographical portraits the author presents, come in pairs or triplets.  People of differing temperaments, background, and skill-sets manage to find each other and create something important.  Jobs had Woz, Gates had Allen, and Moore had Noyce  Unsurprisingly, many of those collaborations were short-lived as egos and differences caused splits. The author does mention a couple of lone-inventors, but they only serve to reinforce the story.  They may have had a great idea, and even a good start to an innovation - but without the right surroundings and collaborators, it often didn’t lead to anything lasting. </p> \n\n<p>In the final chapter, Isaachsen also takes the chance to speculate on how technology and computers will continue to evolve, and gives new meaning to his collaboration theme. He begins with the fears that computers will become so powerful and intelligent that they will become a threat to humankind - like HAL in 2001 space odyssey or Skynet of The Terminator films.  Isaachsen rightfully downplays this idea.  He gives a nice anecdote about chess-playing computers.  Deep Blue by IBM managed to beat the best human player in the world already in 1997 - a digital generation ago.  Yet he notes that in tournaments where players are free to enter in collaboration with a computer - it is not the best computer or the best human, nor even the combination of both that wins. Instead it is often a combination of computers and people who are savvy about using them.</p>\n\n<p>The point he leaves the reader with is that those that are best able to make use of computers will be best placed to succeed in a world with ever more computing power.  This has some important implications for a lot of fields, but especially education.  I was fortunate enough to have several programming courses available to me in high school - 15 years ago.  But when I started college, there was no requirement for taking a computing course of any kind - and I studied math! Nor did any requirements to take a computer science courses exist when I studied Economics and Management Science at the graduate level, even though both fields increasingly rely on programming skills.  As The Innovators compellingly lays out, computing and programming are becoming essential skills in the modern world - the education system is lagging badly.</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"tragedy_of_london_transit\">\n<h3>The Tragedy of London Transit</h3>\n<h3>February 21st, 2014</h3> \n\n<p>London is one of the world´s great cities, built up, piece-meal, through thousands of years of history. London, in theory, should be a great city for walking and wandering: Block to block, neighborhood to neighborhood, to and from work. But after three weeks here, I feel a palpable frustration that London is such a bad city for walking and biking.  Cars - driving fast and paying little heed to pedestrians- dominate the roads. In a city with some of the most expensive real estate anywhere on earth, parking takes up huge swathes of space. Masks - to filter out the dangerous diesel fumes- are a common sight.  Things may be getting better, but the pace is slow, and the hurdles large. </p> \n\n<p>Even short walks in London entail brief periods of fear and tension.  Taxi-drivers, who I assume must be recruited from a population of psychopathic inmates - speed down London´s narrow roads, swinging into sideroads with barely a glance. They tend to accelerate towards crossing pedestrians, rather than slowing down. Other drivers appear to be imitating their behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The street layout doesn´t help.  Even in heavily traveled streets, clearly marked cross-walks - showing that pedestrians have the right-of-way - are rare.  The rule for most streets seems to be to cross as long as you don´t get in the way of a car. Well-intentioned markings reminding foreigners to “look left” or “look right”, reinforce the message that cars have the right of way. Pedestrians beware. </p> \n\n<p>Pedestrian streets - the hallmark and highlight of many European capitals - are auspiciously missing in London.  Most of the street space on Oxford street - London´s main shopping thoroughfare - is reserved for fast-moving motor traffic.  If the store-owners had any sense they would be campaigning furiously to turn over the entire street to pedestrians and increase the flow of customers. </p> \n\n<p>Dense, well-functioning city centres are built around pedestrians.  Cars, if present, are guests.  London has it backwards. </p> \n\n<p>I have biked in quite a few cities with varying quality of bicycle infrastructure.  But I am thoroughly impressed by the brave Londoners who use bikes to get around the city, despite the horrid conditions.  In some major junctions, bicycles make up nearly a quarter of the rush-hour vehicles.  This despite roads and intersections that, until recently, were designed with no thought towards accommodating bicycles. London, with its flat terrain and mild weather, could easily rival Copenhagen or Amsterdam as a biking city.  If only it felt safe to jump on a bike and pedal to your destination. </p> \n\n<p>Some things are getting better - especially for bicylists.  “Cycling Superhighway” routes have been put in place over the last few years, and more are planned.  Yet these are fairly half-assed projects.  I came across a section filled with parked cars - apparently not an uncommon phenomenon.  These “highways” also come to an abrupt stop as they near downtown.  Recently, the Major’s office announced an initiative to create complete north-south and east-west bicycle routes made up of protected bike paths.  If the mayor is able to actually carry this through, it would be a big boost.  Yet the sign of a really good bicycling city is that it is possible to safely get nearly anywhere on a bicycle - not just a few routes. </p> \n\n<p>Absent from any discussions that I have heard are proposals that would introduce the radical measures necessary to really make London a city for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Cities like Paris and Barcelona talk of completely closing off areas of the downtown to cars.  Others like New York and Stockholm aim for zero pedestrian fatalities by dramatically lowering speed limits and introducing more pedestrian zones.  No such wide-scale reforms appear to be being discussed in London, let alone implemented.  For a dense, flat, and vibrant city like London, this is tragic. </p>\n</article> \n\n\n<article id=\"why_nations_fail\">\n<h3>Review of Why Nations Fail</h3>\n<h3>February 3rd, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>I just finished up Why Nations Fail by the economist Daron Acemeglu and the political scientist James Robinson.  The main message is that what consistently characterizes rich, well functioning societies are inclusive and pluralistic political and economic institutions, that is governments for and by the people, and economies that provides everyone with the opportunity to succeed. </p>\n\n<p>I had a bit of a “well, duh!” reaction to this argument.  Of course institutions matter.  And that these institutions are built-up due to seemingly arbitrary historical processes, as they argue, is also not surprising.  For England, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, the authors discuss how both the Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution were important mileposts in the building up of that country's political and economic institutions.  Anyone who has taken a college course in European history would hardly find this to be a revelation.</p> \n\n<p>What the authors don’t spend a whole lot of time explaining though, is that their arguments might well be controversial among an influential group of people: economists.  The typical economist explanation for why some countries are rich and some poor typically center around free markets, free trade, and access to capital.  Institutions, surprisingly, don’t often feature in the economists’ models.  This becomes less surprising after realizing that up until the recent financial crisis, most macroeconomic models didn’t take into account a financial sector.  \n</p>\n<p>The real strength of this book then is that it gets out of the economists’ intellectual vacuum.  They use material from political science, history, sociology and anthropology in order to explain, often through historical cases, how “inclusive” political and economic institutions are built up, and why that leads to sustained economic growth.  Economic concepts like incentives, innovation and creative destruction are mainly used as the glue - binding all the disparate parts.</p>    \n\n<p>One line, relatively early in the book, made a particular impact on me.  The authors noted how inclusive economic and political institutions gives individuals the opportunity to pursue their ambitions and make use of their individual skills and abilities. A simple statement, with a lot of personal resonance.  \n</p>\n<p>I thought back to my time living in Stockholm and the frustration of finding an apartment in the highly regulated rental market there.  The rental system in Stockholm is a (very) mild form of what the authors call an exclusionary economic institution.  The rental system works well for the insiders - in the Stockholm case, those that have lived in Stockholm their whole lives and can get a nice apartment in a central location inexpensively because they have many years in the system. \n</p>\n<p>For outsiders - young people from outside stockholm, immigrants, and those wishing to stay for shorter stays - the system fails completely.  I was forced on the black market - paying exorbitant rent for a tiny apartment.  The system is probably responsible for deterring a lot of young people from moving to the otherwise economically dynamic Stockholm region, and stops investment in much needed housing.  Economic growth is impeded.  It also leads to a lot of unnecessary frustration.  \n</p>\n<p>Of course, on the whole, Sweden is a well-functioning place, with well-functioning institutions and a well-functioning democracy.  The impact that kleptocratic governments like those in Zimbabwe or North Korea have on a society are orders of magnitude more destructive.  \n</p>\n<p>This is where I also have my biggest gripe with the book.  The book is rife with historical as well as present day case studies and examples - but almost exclusively featuring the stories of elite figures like kings, presidents and war lords.  I think the message of this book could have been a lot more powerful if they spent more time showing how institutions matter to normal, everyday people, that the average reader can relate too.  After all, that is, in the end, why economic growth is important - its impact on normal people.  \n</p>\n</article> \n\n\n\n\n<article id=\"oil_and_ecars\">\n<h3>The attractiveness of electric cars has little to do with the price of oil</h3>\n<h3>January 21st, 2015</h3> \n<p>My letter in the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/313360bc-a00c-11e4-aa89-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3QbWI34WR\">Financial Times, January 21st, 2015</a></p>\n\n<p>Sir, The threat electric cars face from falling oil prices is overblown (<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/73087796-9e79-11e4-a37e-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3QbWI34WR\">“Electric cars and biofuels ‘likely to be biggest green victims of oil price falls’ ”, January 19</a>).

Det er bare seks måneder siden prisen var vel over 100 dollar fatet. I dag er prisen under 50. Økt utvinning av skiferolje i USA er grunnen som er mest trukket fram som en forklaring. Men det er også en annen forklaringer som sjelden blir nevnt: Vi er i begynnerfasen av en teknologisk transportrevolusjon.</p>\n\n<p>Skiferoljen har hatt en betydelig effekt på det globale oljemarkedet og den amerikanske økonomien. Total oljeproduksjon i USA har økt med mer enn 60 prosent i løpet av de siste fem årene, og nesten all ekstra produksjon kommer fra skiferfelt i Texas og Nord Dakota. Det blir nå pumpet ut mer olje i USA enn i Saudi Arabia.</p>  \n\n<p>Men prisen på oljen gjenspeiler ikke bare tilbud og etterspørsel i dag, men også forventninger om hva tilbud og etterspørsel blir i framtiden. Her er det stor risiko for oljeprodusentene.</p>\n\n<p>For femti år siden, ble olje brukt til å lage strøm, for oppvarming, til å produsere plastikk og kjemikalier og til å lage bensin og diesel for transport.  Men i dag er oljen hovedsakelig brukt til transport.</p>\n\n<p>Imidlertid er det store forandringer på vei. Først, måten vi bruker bilen på begynner å endre seg. Stadig færre unge mennesker velger å ta førerkort. Sjåførservice som Über og bildeling som Bilringen har gjort bilen unødvendig for mange. I mange byer er det blit økt fokus på gåing, sykling og offentlig transport.</p>\n\n<p>Men den viktigste forandringen er elektrifisering av transport. Om man hadde lyst til å kjøpe en elektrisk bil fra et kjent bilselskap for fire år siden, hadde man bare et valg - Nissan Leaf. I dag kan man velge blant mer enn 20 modeller.</p>\n\n<p>Dagens elbiler har svært begrenset rekkevidde, men utviklingen i batteriteknologien skjer raskt. GM la nylig frem sine planer om å lansere en elbil i 2016 med 300 kilometer rekkevidde til en pris rundt 230.000 kroner. Tesla har også planer om å utvikle en bil med like god rekkevidde som sin Model S, men som koster halvdelen.</p>    \n\n<p>Hvis oljeprodusentene ser for seg at en stor andel av fremtidens biler kjører på strøm, kan det hende at de nå velger å selge så mye som mulig. Dette kan forklare hvorfor vi har sett økende produksjon fra land som Saudi Arabia og Russland i det siste halvåret tross sterkt fallende oljepriser. Kanskje ser de for seg en framtid med mange færre kunder.</p>\n</article>\n\n\n\n\n<article id=\"klimaforsikring\">\n<h3>Billig Klimaforsikring</h3>\n<h3>January 6th, 2014</h3> \n\n<a href=\"http://www.e-pages.dk/bergenstidende/1700/article/227941/31/4/render/?token=5207fb9bf5f917b5276532ef05164266\">Fra BT, 6. januar</a>\n\n<p>Mange Bergensere tar en reise til Syden i denne årsperioden til å nyte varme og sol. Man forventer at det går bra på ferien. Likevel kjøper de alle fleste reiseforsikring. Det kan gå galt og det er relativt lite man må betale for å forsikre seg.</p>\n\n<p>Klimaskeptikere mener at det til tross for klimaendring antagelig kommer til å gå bra med Norge og kloden. Å bruke penger på å bekjempe klimaendring er derfor bortkastet.\nI Norge kommer det sannsynligvis til å gå bra. Men det er stor risiko og usikkerhet tilknyttet til å endre på atmosfæren.

For å stabilisere karbondioksid på et forholdsvis lavt nivå blir det anslått av IPCC at det vil koste rundt 0,06 prosent fra den årlige globale økonomiske veksten. For en nordman som tjener 400.000 kroner i året blir dette cirka 240 kroner i år. For sammenlignen, kjøpte jeg nylig en burger og en øl på byen og fikk en regning på 250 kroner. Jeg regner det som billig forsikring.\n</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"sense_of_style\">\n<h3>Review of A Sense of Style</h3>\n<h3>January 4th, 2015</h3> \n\n<p>A Sense of Style by Steven Pinker is one of the most readable writing and style guides out there.  This is not setting the bar particularly high. But I did genuinely enjoy reading through most of this book.  Pinker presents a lot of common-sense tips for writing with improved clarity and grace.  I felt the book got bogged down in the grammatical and linguistic terminology sometimes - especially in the last chapter.  Then again, perhaps this was required to satisfy the grammar-heads.</p>\n\n<p>In my academic writing, I have had several referees and reviewers comment on my “narrative” style.  The reviewers are not paying me a compliment.  Instead they imply that this style of leading the reader through whatever the topic of the paper is in a story-like form is not appropriate for a serious academic paper.  I felt vindicated by Pinker’s pushing of Classical Style - the idea of the writer serving as a guide, directing the reader’s attention at whatever topic or idea is being explored. </p> \n\n<p>Classical Style, Pinker points out, contradicts a lot of the silly dogma that has grown around academic writing.  Not using personal pronouns like “I” or “we” in a paper is a good example: writing “this research shows”, rather than “I show”.  Pinker argues that the use of personal pronouns stimulate a conversation, helping to engage the reader.  I could add that they also convey a sense of academic honesty.  Any piece of research is necessarily an imperfect collection of  trade-offs and decisions about methods, data, and theory.  A researcher that uses “I” is being more honest about their imperfect role in the research process. </p> \n\n<p>Perhaps the thing I liked best about the book, and which many may find most frustrating is how Pinker avoids simple formulas.  Passive sentences are fine - in the right context.  He does provide the readers with a few guidelines - like ending sentences heavy.  But for the most part, his advice is to trust your own sense of logic.  Good advice like reading your prose out loud, having someone else read through it, and putting it away for a while and then rereading it, are meant to get the reader to activate their own intuitive sense of good writing.</p>\n\n<p>There were times where I felt a bit bogged down by the book.  The last chapter, where pinker essentially goes through a list of grammatical Frequently Asked Questions, was hard to get through (and I ended up skimming much of it).  The idea of analyzing sentences with sentence trees, which he spends an entire chapter on, seemed to be more suited to linguistic students than writers with aspirations of improving their prose.  The formal language of grammar, which there is a lot of in this book, has always made my head go slightly numb.  Still, I can imagine that there are readers that would feel cheated if these things were not included in a book on writing and style.  The book still had plenty to offer to someone like me with little training or interest in the science of grammar. </p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"hacking_bayes\">\n<h3>Review of Bayesian Methods for Hackers</h3>\n<h3>December 27th, 2014</h3> \n\n<p>I recently worked my way through Bayesian Methods for Hackers - I will call it Hacking Bayes from now on -  by <a href=\"http://www.camdp.com/\">Cam Davidson-Pilon</a>, an applied statistician, programmer and consultant. The “book” is an introduction to Bayesian analysis using the Python programming language and the PyMC package.   I put “book” in quotes because the form is not typical of a book or ebook.  The book is written as an online iPython notebook, where executable code and figures are integrated in the text.  The book is also freely available on the web, <a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/djv/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/master/\">here</a>. </p> \n\n<p>Hacking Bayes is not meant to be read.  You learn by working through the example code.  Details of the nitty-gritty math are then either saved for after the problems or left out completely.  For those interested in a hands-on approach to learning Bayesian methods, this works great.  For the most part, the examples and writing are clear and easy to follow.  Perhaps the biggest advantage of this book is that it is also an introduction to the powerful PyMC Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation package for python.  The path from working through this book to doing your own analysis is short.</p> \n\n<p>This is the second book I have worked through on Bayesian methods with a computational and programming approach.  The first being Think Bayes, by Allen Downey, which I also liked.  But the two books are distinct.  Downey spent a lot of time building up the computational tools from the ground-up.  Many of the problems he worked through were simple discrete problems, where the posterior could be calculated explicitly.  And he wrote his own code for doing Bayesian updating, which readers could try to read through and decipher.</p>  \n\n<p>Hacking Bayes is different.  Where Downey included a single chapter on simulation methods, Pilon-Davison focuses nearly exclusively on simulation methods using the PyMC package.  While the reader misses out on a deeper understanding that comes from doing the explicit calculations of updating a prior, the usefulness of these explicit methods is limited.  Simulation methods, on the other hand, can be modified to tackle a broad range of problems.  I think the trade-off between understanding and applicability is worth it in this case.</p>  \n\n<p>Hacking bayes is not a polished finished product.  Typos pop-up every once in a while, as well as the author's notes to himself like “add something here later”.  This roughness does not seriously detract from the book, and seems in line with the gradual improvement ethos of software engineers: put out a functional product, then improve over time based on feedback.</p>\n\n<p>My experience with this book, as well as all other methodology books, is that simply reading through the text, and running the scripts is not enough to become proficient.  To get the most out of the book, you should try your own analysis with your own data, using the examples as templates.  I am doing just that with some oil-well drilling data.  Once I have something in a roughly good form, I will put it up on my website. </p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"solar_dumping\">\n<h3>Solar Dumping</h3>\n<h3>December 19th, 2014</h3> \n\n\n<p>The US Commerce Department recently decided to impose duties on Chinese and Taiwanese solar panels.

The catch word, “Disruptive Innovation” has been thrown around quite a bit.  But after having recently read the book, I realized that Christensen’s main point is actually pretty subtle. I also think the idea of disruptive innovation is powerful in helping to understand the changes that are buffering the power industry. </p> \n\n<p>Established companies that are disrupted by a new technology - think work-station computer makers who failed to see the PC-era coming - were not victims of poor management and bad business models.  In fact, exactly the opposite.  Christensen makes the argument that established firms that get blindsided by a disruptive innovation are doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing.  They are listening to their customers, trying to expand their margins, grow their company, and improve their current technologies. </p>\n\n<p>Like the first crop of underpowered, toy-like PCs, technologies that grow to be disruptive tend not to be particularly attractive to an established company’s existing customers.  Usually, the early technologies serve only a niche market - like the hobbyists that bought the first Apple PCs.  A manager in an established firm can be excused for not pushing a technology that does not appeal to their customers, doesn’t spur much growth and on top of it all, doesn’t appear to be particularly profitable.  The problem for the established companies comes when these technologies follow a “s-curve” of technological change. The niche product \n</p>\n\n<p>The utilities business has been essentially unchanged for a 100 years.  Their basic model has been to build big, centralized power plants to take advantage of economies of scale.  The plants should be dispatchable - when demand goes up, they should be able to ramp up production.  And as a whole, the system needs to be 99.99 percent reliable.  \n</p>\n\n<p>No surprise then that renewable energy technologies have not historically been popular with big utilities.  They were generally small-scale and geographically distributed, intermittent and not dispatchable.  Early investors in wind turbines in places like Denmark, The Netherlands, and Germany tended to be small investors and cooperatives.  The big energy companies stuck to what they knew best.  \n</p>\n\n<p>But things are changing.  Both wind and solar power have now become so advanced and so cheap that they compete, and increasingly out-compete coal and natural gas plants.  Onshore wind power in the US has recently been auctioned at 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kilowatt-hour).  The utility that serves Austin, TX recently bought solar power generation for 5 cents per kWh.  Those are prices that are lower than what natural gas and coal producers can afford to bid. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest disruptions have so far taken place in Germany.  Almost everyone was surprised by how fast capacity was built up following the introduction of generous feed-in tariffs.  The big utilities in Germany - Eon, RWE and Vattenfall - invested heavily in traditional generation in the early 2000’s.  They were then hit by a combination of lower consumption due to the financial and economic crisis, the shut-down of their profitable Nuclear power reactors, and not least the boom in renewables that have pressed down market prices. </p>\n\n<p>The utilities are trying their best to cope.  RWE recently broke itself in two - splitting off its traditional gas, coal and nuclear generation.  The hope being that a company squarely focused on renewables will be more nimble and less weighed down by their legacy assets.  Eon is also aiming to reinvent itself into a energy services company.</p>  \n\n<p>But other companies have got a big head start.  German firms that sell, install and manage solar panels are some of the most efficient in the world.  And because of these efficient firms, total system costs of solar power systems tend to be cheaper in Germany than most other countries.  The big energy utilities will have a hard time catching up to these nimble players. \n</p>\n\n<p>The utilities are also looking for a lifeboat from the government and regulators.  They argue that they should be paid for simply having capacity in case of an emergency - so called capacity payments.  But the big centralized plants they own are unlikely to be well adept at providing short-term back-up and regulating power for renewables.  On the other hand, normal market prices should reflect long-term generation investment needs.  If prices are so low that coal and gas plants are not profitable, then it simply means that coal and gas plants are not needed.  Capacity payments appear to be a dead-end. \n</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"budapest\"> \n<h3>Budapest</h3>\n<h4>December 3rd, 2014</h4>\n<p> I visited Budapest for the first time a few weeks ago.  It is a fun and interesting city. It can be described as being in either central or eastern Europe, but its language and culture is unique from its Slavic and German speaking neighbors.  Hungarian is closest to Finnish, though they can apparently not understand each other.  \n</p>\n\n<p>Budapest is a fun walking city - especially if you can handle some hills.  We wandered around the castle area a big chunk of time as well as The Citadel, which sits atop the highest hilltop in the city centre.  If we had stayed a day or two more, I think we would have taken the trip to the trails in the hills on the outskirts of the city which are also supposed to be quite nice.  </p>\n\n<p>I had read that Budapest was one of the safest big cities in Europe.  At the same time, the cities problems with poverty and alcohol abuse are visible all around.  Parts of the city are magnificent and well kept.  As modern and shining as the nicest parts of London or Paris.  Others are completly run down.  I was surprised by how many beautiful, central buildings appeared in complete disrepair and abandoned.  This is a lasting legacy of the Soviet era when many moved out of the central neighborhoods and little economic incentive existed to keep up the buildings.  Now, the costs of refurbishing the apartments are so high, few are willing to take it on.  Sad, but also an incredible amount of potential lying right in a historic city center.</p>\n\n<p> \nThe food scene can probably be described as up-and-coming. We found a hip burger place by accident.  We also ate at a chic restaurant called Zona with a very reasonable three-course lunch (about 10 EUR) and found a cozy local cafe that served a solid breakfast and even had live guitar music playing.  The rest was a mixed bag.  We relied on a mix of personal recomendations and trip-advisor, and we ended up in a lot of \"Traditional Hungarian Food\" type places with a lot of other tourists and heavy, kind of bland dishes.  Calling ahead to reserve tables at the hip places the foody locals go to would probably be worth it, and from what we observed, not necessarily that much more expensive.  We did have hungarian wine with almost every meal.  The white wines we tasted were mild, tasty, and reasonably priced.  \n</p>\n\n<p> \nGetting around was easy.  A solid subway system will take you most places, while a quaint tram system gives you a more scenic ride.  I bought a three day pass at the airport for about 15 Euro.  The system was straightforward and easy to use and brought you pretty much anywhere you needed to go in the city. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nDespite the solid public transit system, the city is clogged with traffic.  Both sides of the Danube river are taken up by multi-laned highways, and the city is criss-crossed by wide thoroughfares.  A waste of historic and potentially beautiful real estate.  The city is trying to jump on the bicycling trend.  They have a bike sharing system in place, and bike lanes appeared sporatically.  But the bicycling infrastructure still seemed half-baked.  Bicycles were directed to share space with fast moving busses in some places, and bike lanes were haphazardly painted on sidewalks with all sorts of obstacles in their way.  Still, the intention was good, and in a few places, you could even find solid, seperated bike lanes of Danish or Dutch standard.  \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n <article id=\"hoyhus\">\n<h3>Mytene om høyhus</h3> \n<h4>November 6th, 2014</h4>\n<h4> <a href=\"http://www.bt.no/meninger/debatt/Mytene-om-hoye-bygg-3234980.html\">I dagens BT:</a></h4> \n\n<p> Bystyret har nylig vedtatt bygging av et 16-etasjer høyhus i Møllendal. Bestemmelsen har vært kontroversiell fordi høyden på det foreslåtte huset strider i mot områdeplanene til Møllendal. I den sentrale og attraktive bydelen Møllendal burde det ikke bygges ett høyhus. Det burde bygges mange. Mytene om høyhus har blitt repetert så mange ganger at selv fagfolk oppfatter dem som fakta. Høyhus vil gjøre Bergen sentrum til en mer miljøvennlig, rimelig og livlig plass å bo. Dette burde prioriteres over diffuse estetiske unnskyldninger.</p>  \n\n<p>Den første myten om høyhus er at man kan få like mange leiligheter med å ta i bruk lavhus.

Man får plass til mange flere leiligheter når man bygger 15 etasjer enn når man bygger 5.  </p>\n\n<p>Høyhusmotstanderene vil ofte mene at lavhus kan bygges tettere, men det er lite grunn for at man ikke også kan bygge høyhus tett. Et eksempel på dette er Nordnes, hvor man finner tett-bygget områder med høyde mellom 8 og 15 etasjer.</p>\n\n<p>En annen myte er at det er dyrt å bygge høyt og høyhus vil føre til høyere boligpriser. Faktum er at kostnadene ved å bygge høyt er forholdsvis beskjedne. Med dagens boligpriser i sentrum, er det svært lønnsomt å bygge høyt og utnytte dyre tomter. Utbyggerne vil gjerne bygge høyt om de får lov. </p>\n\n<p>Det er sant at leiligheter i sentrumsnære høyhus er attraktive plasser å bo og dermed blir prisen på den enkelte leilighet høy. Men å bygge høyt og tett i sentrum betyr at man får plass til mange flere leiligheter. Dette vil holde prisene nede totalt sett. </p> \n\n<p>Den tredje myten er at høyhus ødelegger byens sjarm og folkelighet. Jeg synes de små trehusene på Nordnes er sjarmerende, men det ville vært feil å si at Bergen sentrum ville blitt mer sjarmerende om det bare fantes små trehus. Få kunne da ha bodd i sentrum. En livlig og sjarmerende by er først og fremst preget av at alle type mennesker kan bo der. For å få til dette trenger vi å bygge høyt og tett.</p> \n\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id =\"fast_trains\">\n<h3>Fast Trains</h3>\n<p>  \nOne of the experiences I was looking forward to for my trip to China was taking the bullet train from Beijing to Shanghai - a trip of about 1200km that can now be done comfortably by train in five hours.  The network of express tracks that China has built over the last decade - with a top regulated speed of about 300 km/h - is an engineering marvel.</p> \n\n<p>\nThe Beijing to Shanghai route opened in 2010 after only two years of construction.  It halved the time by train between the cities, and doubled the train capacity.  Likely it has taken a large chunk of the airline traffic as well, though the train stations are well outside the city centers - so the express trains lose that advantage over traditional trains that often can bring you to the middle of the city and let you avoid the trip out to the airport.    \n</p>\n\n<p> \nComing from western Europe, where infrastructure projects seem to take ever-longer to complete and almost as a rule go way over budget, the speed and efficiency of Chinese building is marvelous.  But the Chinese have also run into problems.  The top speed of the express trains was reduced from 350 km/h after a derailment that left 90 dead in 2011.  \n</p>\n\n<p>  \nTechnology overconfidence has also led to China´s version of the bridge to nowhere - the Shanghai maglev train to nowhere.  A maglev train uses superconductors to float over the guiding rail.  With little to no friction, speeds of well over 400 km/h can be reached.  The technology was developed in the west and in Japan, but the Chinese have built the only operating commercial line to the Shanghai international airport. </p> \n\n<p>\nThe line was completed in 2004, but on average runs with only 20 percent of its carrying capacity.  Part of the problem is that it runs from the airport to an outer part of the city that requires another 20 minute subway trip into the center.  The train is also relatively expensive - costing 40 rmb, not much less than a taxi ride.  \n </p>\n\n <p> \nPlans had been made to extend the line in 2006, initially to Shanghai´s other airport and neighboring train terminal and potentially continuing on to the major city of Hangzou.  But the project was cancelled after both protests from residents worried about noise and rumored radiation effects from the maglev line.  Perhaps just as important, a traditional high-speed line was completed to Hangzou as part of the large nationwide build-out.  A good example of economies of scale trumping newer, fancier technologies.  \n</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id =\"shanghai\"> \n<h3>Shanghai</h3>\n\n<p>I´ve now spent three days in Shanghai, a city with sharp contrasts with Beijing.  As a port city, Shanghai has a long history of being outwardly focused and you notice the western influence on the city right away.  At the same time, the city reflects the full scale and ambition of modern China. </p>\n\n<p>  \nShanghai is the largest city in the world with somewhere around 24 million people living within its city boarders.  That scale is on display everywhere you go.  Even more amazing is that much of the modern infrastructure was built within the last decade or two.  The modern, efficient and extremely well planned metro is an experience in itself.  Unlike in the New York metro, where the doors seperate the cars in the train, all the cars are connected so you can see down the full length of the inside of the train.  But the trains are so long that you can not usually see the end of the train from inside.\n</p>\n\n<p>  \nShanghai´s history is entangled with Europe as well as other asian nations.  This creates some lively contrasts.  On the famous Bund, a mishmatch of lowrise buildings in traditional European architecture are on one side of the river, a relic from the times when foreigners controlled much of the trade through Shanghai and China.  Here you could think you were in London or Berlin.  On the opposite side of the river is the new ultra high-rise financial district, where the second tallest building in the world is being built.  You can guess which side the cameras are turned too.  The bund is the ultimate symbol of an emerging China overshadowing and and nearly litteraly rising above western nations.  \n</p>\n</article>\n\n<!-- <article id=\"efficient_chinese\">\n<h3>The Efficient Chinese</h3>\n\n<p> \nThe Chinese have a reputation for being frugal.  They are hard bargainers and hate paying more than necessary.  When it comes to \n</p>  \n\n</article> -->\n\n<article id=\"china_energy\">\n<h3>China´s Coal Problem and Promise</h3> \n\n<p>One of my hopes about attending an energy economics conference in China was that I would get some clarity from insiders and experts on what often seems like an opaque Chinese energy policy.  The conference is now over and the results are a mixed bag.  We heard from both some mid- to high-ranking officials as well as senior professors and university administrators that presumably also have party contacts.  In the end, anything close to clarity was hard to find, but you could read between the lines.  </p>\n\n<p> I was glad to see that it is not only Norwegian politicians that are good at double-talk.  Several of the high ranking speakers managed to both emphasize the necessity of environmental protection while still insisting that a continued increase in coal consumption was necessary and that a top in coal consumption and emissions was unlikely until 2030. </p>\n\n<p> \nTo me, this seemed pessimistic (or optomistic depending on the viewpoint.)  One speaker referred to the environment as the ceiling for the level of coal consumption.  In that case, it is hard to see how that ceiling has not been met.  September is one of the better months in terms of Beijing´s air quality, yet most days a thick haze is present.  The Chinese - including those with influence - are plainly aware of this everyday hazard.  Already, plans are in place to reduce air pollution - primarily related to the burning of coal - around cities. \n</p>\n\n<p>Other sources of energy are also quickly expanding.  China has a goal of having 15 percent renewables by 2020.  Wind power has grown enormously over the last few years and now makes up for more generation than nuclear power even though the Chinese have been developing nuclear for 40 years.  Solar power is also expanding quickly, and China is now the worlds largest market for solar panels.  Nuclear power is also expected to expand greatly in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p> And then there is the demand side.  The economy is slowing and energy use likely even more so.  Seasonally adjusted power production decreased by 2 percent in august.  Establing a trend from any one month of data is dangerous, but taken together with other signs of slowing like falling house prices as well as an intention by the government of making the economy more energy efficient and less investment heavy (and in turn energy intensive), it seems plausible that the pace of power plant building will surely slow.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the end, a convergence of forces seems to be happening.  The economy is slowing and becoming less energy-intensive.  The government is placing more emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental protection.  Wind and solar power have become cheap - in many places cheaper than coal and gas.  I wouldn´t be surprised if in a few years, 2014 is seen as the year where coal consumption and emissions peaked.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"getting_around_beijing\"> \n<h3>Getting around Beijing</h3>\n\n<p>Beijing is a sprawling place.  A friend who we met up with who had been gone in the US for eight years said she barely recognized the city.  When she left there had been three ring roads.  Soon there would be 6.  Getting around a city that is at once sprawling and at the same time packed can be a challenge - and Beijing has both good and bad elements.</p>\n\n<p>Up until a few years ago, the bicycle dominated the street landscape.  But unlike in other quickly developing cities, it has not been completly pushed aside by cars.  Wide protected bikelanes are present on almost all the streets and the bicycle is still a popular way to get around.  The bike lanes are also surprisingly egalitarian - used by both the poor as well as better off youngsters on hip fixed-gear cycles.</p>\n\n<p>Walking is a mixed experience in Beijing.  Wide walking paths are present along most streets, but many drivers find them to be convenient places to park.  I would have expected China to be better at enforcing parking laws.  September is widely known as the most pleasant month in Beijing.  Pleasant temperatures and relatively little pollution - though the smog is still worryingly noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>The subway system is amazing.  So much of it has been built in just the last few years that a guidebook that is more than 2 years old is practically useless.  You can get seemingly anywhere on the subways, and the trains run nearly continuously.  But the cars are nearly always packed - and we have not even tried to use the subway during the morning and evening rush. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the subway is the price: 2 yuan - about 30 US cents gets you from any one place in the system to the other.  A bus ticket in Bergen costs 5 dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the efficiency of the subway, we have also taken our fair share of taxi trips, which are relatively cheap and can be an efficient way of getting around if the traffic is light.  That is a big \"if\" though.  Beijing traffic is notorious for being congested, and a 15 minute trip can easily turn into 45 minutes, which we experienced personally.  </p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id= \"beijing_first_impressions\">\n\n\n\n<h3>Beijing, First Impressions</h3>\n\n<p> I arrived on Thursday morning in Beijing for a conference and some sight seeing.  The first surprise was how easy it was getting through the airport.  It only took about 10 minutes to get through immigration.  My passport picture doesnt look much like me anymore - I had short hear, a light beard and different glasses at the time.  The immigration agent gave me a few extra looks, but then waived me through without too much hasle.  Getting into China is easier then getting into the US is my experience so far.  </p>\n\n<p>I took a cab with a colleague to the conference hotel and I was again suprised by how green the outskirts of the city were.  Trees and greenery were everywhere.  I was more expecting the industrial and resedential sprawl you see around New York´s airports.  We arrived around midday, so traffic wasn´t too bad either.  As I had been told to expect, the cab didnt have any functioning seat belts.  That was somewhat unnerving, but it turned out allright. </p>\n\n<p>Usually these types of conferences use a handful of student assistants and maybe a secretary or two to help with the logisitics.  The Chinese, on the other hand, have no problem using considerably more resources.  It feels like they have put to work at least a 100 students to help with everything from registration to getting the guests from one venue to the other.  All the students are helpful, eager, and seem somewhat sleep deprived.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I was able to walk around the area a bit.  The conference is located in the outskirts of the city where many of the universities are co-located.  The geosciences university, which is hosting the conference, is in a type of gated off residential section.  Cars drive slowly and plenty of space is given over to walkers and bikers.  Walking around is actually quite pleasant - especially considering the chaos that I expected.</p>\n\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"thinkbayes_review\"> \n<h3>Review of Think Bayes</h3>\n\n<p> The last couple of months I have been reading and working through the book Think Bayes by Allen B. Downey.  First - one of the best things about this book in a world of overpriced text books - you can get a pdf for free from the website of Green Tea Press:  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/.  And in general, I can highly recommend this book, both for self-learners as well as for lecturers in statistics and analysis courses.  The hands-on and accessible philosophy of this book is refreshing.  After having finished working through the book, you get a good working intuition of what bayesian analysis is and how to do it.  As a bonus, you also get some bonus lessons in good programming skills and practices.  I have a few gripes, but they are relatively minor - and can be overcome by pairing the book with other resources out there. </p> \n\n<p> Before working my way through this book, I knew of bayesian statistics and analysis but in a very abstract sense.  From my courses in mathematical statistics I knew what bayes theorem was and I had even worked my way through some of the algebra of some bayesian statistical models.  But I had little sense of how to actually use bayesian analysis in an applied setting.  </p>\n\n<p> Think Bayes works, especially as a self-learning text, because it recognizes that you learn best by actually doing an analysis.  Nearly every chapter works out a problem - through python code.  Explanation of the underlying logic and math comes after the code.  This works much better than the typical theory-then-example layout of most textbooks.  Implementation is the focus of the book, not something that, if you’re lucky, is thrown into an appendix or an online compendium.</p>\n\n<p> After going through the book, I feel like I have a good starting point for implementing my own analysis - and I have a few ideas I would like to try out.  I am also starting to work through the more comprehensive Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman and his team of coauthors and I am better able to follow along this book after first having worked through Think Bayes. </p> \n\n<p> If I have a gripe, it is that the author is a bit too good at following good programming practices.  Downey makes the most of Python’s object oriented design, and encapsulates a lot of the code in functions and classes, calling it as needed.  While this is good programming practice, it makes it harder to follow along with the logic of the code.  Especially in the later, more complicated problems, I would have preferred a more linear, all-in-one code.  But, like I said, this is a small issue in an otherwise well thought-out book on how to do bayesian analysis. </p>\n\n</article>\n\n\n<article id =\"sykkelpartiethoyre\">\n<h4>Fra 4-09-2014 papirutgaven av BT  </h4>\n\n<h3>Sykkelpartiet Høyre</h3>\n\n<p> Etter vårens rabalder om bybanesaken og Filip Ryggs avgang , skal snart et nytt byråd for byutvikling utnevnes.

In particular, China has plans to build a set of massive coal gasification plants - where coal is turned into natural gas in the interior of the county and then piped to electricity plants near the big coastal cities.  The idea is that this will replace many of the coal plants that lie near the big coastal cities and which are a major contributor to the extreme air pollution that has become a major worry for the communist party.</p>  \n\n<p>The problem is that coal gasification plants emit much more carbon dioxide than normal coal plants - one \n    <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1153415-coal-based-sng-a-solution-to-chinas-energy.html\">study</a\n> says 80 percent more.  Catherine Wolfram, of the University of California Berkeley <a href=\"http://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/will-smog-in-china-spur-climate-solutions/\">worries</a> that the planned big push for coal gasification might help relieve air pollution of Chinese cities, but in the process it may blow-up efforts to get global emissions of greenhouse gases under control.</p>  \n\n<p>But despite plans on paper, a large-scale operation of coal-to-gas plants in China is unlikely to happen.  As the Seattle Times article details, the one plant that has been built so far in inner mongolia is plagued with problems.  The plant requires massive amounts of water in a region that has little of it.  The local pollution from the plant has stirred up discontent among the locals in the area, especially the minority ethnic mongolians.  But most of all, the coal-to-gas plants are likely a horrible economic investment.</p>\n\n<p>Only a few years ago, the hot topic was carbon capture and storage plants that would make it possible to continue burning coal for electricity while, as the name implies, capturing the carbon emissions and storing (sequestering) them under ground.  A raft of projects made the drawing board, and a handful began construction. But reality soon began to bite.  capture and storage plants were expensive to build and required more than 30% of their own energy production to operate.  Over the last several years in the US, a raft of standard coal plants have been shut down because they couldn’t compete with cheaper natural gas.  More expensive and less efficient capture and storage plants didn’t have a chance. </p> \n\n<p>The story appears to be repeating itself for gas-to-coal plants.  While gasification plants have been touted as having the potential to clean up generation of electricity from coal and even increase efficiency by using combined cycle generation, the reality is that the plants are hugely expensive to build and use a significant amount of the energy they produce just to operate - nulling any gained benefits of increased efficiency from a combined cycle gas turbine.  Only one, heavily subsidized commercial plant has every been built in the US.  That plant, built in the 1970’s, was shut down less than a decade later.  The experience of the one existing plant in China - plagued with technical problems, lack of water and local opposition doesn’t look much better. </p> \n\n<p>China’s approach to energy has been to go all-in on everything - fossil fuels, nuclear, hydro and renewables. But at a certain point, some basic economic and environmental constraints will take hold. China currently uses more coal than the rest of the world combined.  The expansion of Chinese coal use has pushed up coal prices and turned China from a net coal exporter to the largest coal importer. </p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, the Chinese push into renewables has led to a dramatic fall in the prices of wind turbines and especially solar power.  China is building more nuclear power stations than the rest of the world combined including some experimental designs that could prove to be both safer and cheaper to operate.  China also is estimated to have large deposits of shale gas that are being actively developed. Then there is the Chinese economy itself, whose growth has begun to moderate and has entered a more mature consumer-led, less energy-intensive state.</p>  \n\n<p> Coal use in China is on the inevitable decline.  A process that makes getting energy from coal more expensive and less efficient is unlikely to play a significant role in China's energy system </p>\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"my_crappy_teaching\">\n\n<h3>My crappy teaching, and what I have learned from it</h3>\n\n<p>I am gearing up for my post postdoc job hunt and I have begun drafting an application letter.  This has made me think about my (few) experiences teaching so far and how those experiences have influenced my ideas about teaching and teaching effectively.</p>\n\n<p> My teaching experience has so far been light.  But as a PhD student I got the chance to not only be a lecturer for a course but to design the course from scratch.  I co-taught the course Physics and Economics of Renewable Energy in the spring of 2010 and 2011 with a professor of Physics from a neighboring university. </p>\n\n<p> My teaching method for that course was traditional - consisting of lectures where I tried to provide a summary of relevant theory and research and homework assignments for the students.  The evaluations from students were mixed - some expressing an appreciation for a class, but many were critical.  I seemed unsure about the material, they said.  Some thought it would have been better if a real professor taught the course and not a lowly PhD student.  In the end, I think I could have done a better job teaching the course - and as a whole I judge the experience as a failure.  But it was a useful failure.  </p>\n\n<p>A major problem was that I taught in a manner that was different from the way that I myself best learn and do research.   The reason that students judged me as being unsure about the material was because I was.  I was far from sure that the material I was teaching was \"correct.\"  I think a lot of professors have an ability to convey a confidence about what they are teaching.  But in my opinion, it is often a false confidence.</p>   \n\n<p>When I begin a research project I start with a healthy skepticism of the existing base of knowledge.  I insist on doing my own data-heavy, bottom-up analysis.  I have realized that I need to teach in a manner that reflects this.  </p>\n\n<p> As a postdoc, I have not taught my own courses, but I have been a guest lecturer a couple of times.  But instead of a traditional lecture-style setup, where the students are expected to dutifully sit and absorb the wisdom that I pass on to them, I turned the four hours of lectures into a data lab.  Students installed and learned the basics of the statistical programming language R and were instructed in loading in a few relevant data sets, making some figures and otherwise doing a basic data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>I was quite happy with the results.  Student evaluations were generally positive.  One particularly gratifying comment was on the lines of \"I have never done this kind of programming before, but it was a lot of fun!.\"</p>\n\n<p>I plan on incorporating such a hands-on, experiential learning approach into all my future teaching.  Lectures can now easily be recorded and put on the web - freeing up class time for exercises and labs.  The emphasis on data and empirics strengthens understanding of theory by showing its applications.  More so, I believe strongly that basic data analysis skills are becoming essential for a wide array of professionals in government, business and industry.   Teaching data analysis allows me to go from conveying knowledge to allowing students to create their own knowledge. </p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id =\"oil_price_blog\"> \n<h3>For Norwegian off-shore, oil prices don't matter (much)</h3>\n<p>In the absence of good data and appropriate techniques, economists have in the past relied on simplified theoretical models to make predictions about how changes in oil prices can be expected to affect production.  Not surprisingly, most of these models predict that changes in price will affect production.  Yet, the extraction of oil is getting increasingly complex and expensive.  A good case study of this is the petroleum industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, which has made Norway one of the richest countries in the world and by some estimates accounts for nearly one third of Norwegian GDP.  But production in the challenging conditions of the North and Norwegian sea has always been complex and expensive.  When you combine huge fixed costs, an overlapping quilt of regulations and high amounts of uncertainty, it no longer becomes obvious how a change in prices will affect production.</p>\n\n<p> I just put out a <a href=\"#oil_prices\">working paper</a> that takes up this subject.  I don't rely on theoretical models or simulation but rather look at the actual data from the 77 currently or formerly producing oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.  What I find might surprise many economists, but not people working in the industry.  The main result is that changes in oil prices appears to have little to no concurrent affect on production from Norwegian oil fields.  Here I define concurrent in a broad sense - within 3 years.  The intuition of this result is simple.  It is hugely expensive to be operating in the North Sea.  The fixed costs alone for a single field are measured in the billions of dollars.  Companies simply can not afford to have spare capacity sitting idle so that they can increase production if prices increase.  They are producing as much as they can given their current level of infrastructure.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhile I don't find any concurrent reaction to oil prices in existing fields, I do find some lagged effects - after between 4 and 8 years.  This suggests an investment-led reaction.  Indeed, a look at data on investments indicates that changes in the oil price do quickly affect the level of investments.  But here it is important to consider the different phases of an oil field - from the planning to the build out to the depletion stage. Splitting the analysis into these stages suggests that price has little to no effect on fields in the depletion stage - neither concurrent nor lagged.  Instead, the biggest effect price has appears to be in the planning stage.  Again, the intuition is simple.  Once plans have been finalized and the build-out begins, large amounts of capital have been allocated.  More so, detailed plans must be submitted and approved by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate before a build-out can commence.  Changes to these plans would likely incur costly delays.  Thus decisions about the extent of the build-out and in turn the level of production from a field are mainly determined well before production begins. \n</p>\n\n<p> \nA few caveats should be mentioned.  First, these results only apply to existing fields.  Total production from a region can and often does respond to changes in the oil price by way of increased searching as well as starting production from previously un-economic fields.  I do not consider these in this research.  More so, price may affect production in existing fields in more diffuse ways that are not easily picked up by a regression model.  The most important is the affect of technological change.  An increase in the oil price will likely spur more investment in research and development which in turn may lead to better technologies for oil extraction.  Yet the relationship between increased prices, R&D and in turn oil production - while likely real - may be too inconsistent to accurately measure.  \n</p>\n\n<p> \nThis research is timely.  Followers of the Norwegian oil industry will note that the sector appears to be entering into a period of turbulence.  Production is declining yet investment levels are at all time highs.  Oil firms, notable Statoil, are trying to cut costs in order to maintain their level of profitability.  The high level of optimism of just a couple of years ago seems to be quickly receding.  With the notable exception of the Johan Sverdrup oil field, most of the large and giant oil fields were found decades ago.  An increasing share of future investments in the industry will go towards existing fields.  Yet this research shows that production from these fields seems to respond little to changes in prices.    \n</p>\n\n<p> \nOil production from the Norwegian Continental Shelf has nearly halved since its peak in the year 2000.  But the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate has optimistic projections of a leveling-off and even a slight rise in production over the next few years.  The research that lies behind this article has strengthened my skepticism to these optimistic projections.  Even if oil prices increased strongly, production from Norwegian fields will likely continue to decline.  The near- medium- and long-term story of the Norwegian Oil industry is one of decline.  \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id =\"horses\"> \n\n<h3>Horses, humans and cars in NYC</h3>\n\n<p> I recently watched <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/extended-interviews/432760/playlist_tds_extended_bill_deblasio/432745\"> an interview</a>of the new major of New York City, Bill de Blasio, by the comedian Jon Stewart on The Daily Show.  One part of the interview caught my attention.  The new mayor has made a case for banning the horse drawn carriages that carry tourists around the roads near central park.  In the interview, he made the animal welfare case that it wasn't ethical to have these horses out amid the heavy traffic.  Jon Stewart then shot in a joke about how the same should apply to humans.  </p>\n\n<p>De Blasio seemed a bit speechless at first.  The comment was intended as a light-hearted joke, but de Blasio is  smart enough to recognize the logic - and the tangle he got himself into.  de Blasio has been ambivalent - at best - about the steps taken by the Bloomberg administration to make New York more pedestrian and bicycle friendly.

What \"The Sharing Economy\" Really Means</h3>\n\n<p> \nBloomberg news recently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-30/your-idle-lexus-for-rent-seen-as-productivity-revival-economy.html\"> reported</a> on what is being called the \"The Sharing Economy.\"  In the article, the reporter suggests that technology that allows for sharing of consumer durables could be the next big boost in efficiency in the developed and and developing world - in turn powering economic growth.  Despite some hand-waiving, so-far-so-good.  But from there the reporter gets stuck in the idea that a healthy economy makes a lot of stuff.  Sharing will reduce the demand for manufactured stuff and isn't this bad?  The answer, often neglected by politicians and economists alike, is of course no.  And while technology has helped maked sharing easier, a much bigger factor is at play: cities.</p>\n\n<p>Car sharing is the most prominent example of a new sharing model.  Instead of buying a car and then letting it sit idle for at least 95 percent of the day, urban dwellers can join a car-share service.  Here, companies such as Zipcar strategically place cars around a city.  Customers can then rent the cars in hourly blocks over the internet and unlock the cars from their smartphones.  The car is then used much more often than the average private automomobile - the article cites a statistic saying that a car-share vehicle can replace 14 single-owner cars.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNext, the reporter makes a leap of logic and abstraction scales this argument up to other consumer durable goods - hand bags were mentioned in the article.  In the overly abstract economic wording of the article, the \"capital\" - that is the physical stuff - is used much more efficiently in the overall economy.  Higher efficiency - you can do more with the same amount of stuff - in turn powers more economic activity and higher GDP.</p>\n\n<p>\nBut then towards the end of the article, the reporter takes a U-turn.  By reducing demand for vehicles, the reporter writes, car-sharing will perhaps hurt the economy.  So the logic seems to go: sharing will improve the economy, unless it doesn't.\n</p>\n\n<p>The reporter is clearly confused about the issue.  But so, unfortunately, are a lot of people - including even Nobel Prize winners.  Paul Krugman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/opinion/20krugman.html?_r=0\">has written </a> in his blog that the U.S. needs to get back to manufacturing stuff.  In his mind, and many others, selling services - like a car-share - is inferior to selling stuff - like cars. </p>\n\n<p>The Making-stuff-is-best idea is wrong for at least a few reasons.  Consider again the car-sharing example.  A urban-dwelling young person usually has plenty of reasons for ditching a car in favor of a car-sharing service.  Having a car can often be a hassle - finding parking, filling gas, washing the car, and taking it in for repairs.  Some people enjoy doing these tasks, but I would bet most don`t.  With a car-sharing service, a person can skip all these pesky chores and pay someone else to do it.  It still comes out cheaper, since the costs of car mainentance are spread among all the car-sharing-customers.  Jobs are created, and the young urban-dweller can spend more of their time doing things they enjoy.  </p>\n\n<p>If car-sharing really took off, it could very well mean fewer cars are sold, and this would impact the car industry.  But the flip side is that the young urban dwellers have more money in their pocket.  They can then go out and use that money on restaurant meals, and have a few beers out on the town.  More restaurants and bars open.  This is what is meant by increased efficiency.  The young urban dweller can still get out of town or pick up some furniture with the car-share service, but in addition he or she can also buy an extra restaurant meal or concert.</p>\n\n<p>But in a way, the sharing economy is not anything new.  And as my example of the young urban-dweller suggests, it has less to do with technology and more to do with cities.  When I lived in New York City I would always deliver my laundry to a laundromat and for about 11 dollars I could pick it up the next day - smelling fresh and nicely folded.  It was great.  As far as I know, no laundromats exist in Bergen and I had to buy my own washing machine, which stands idle 99 percent of the time.  What a waste!  A laundromat, in other words, is really a washing-machine-share service. A restuarant could be considered a kitchen-share with some cooking thrown in.  A cafe is an espresso-machine-share.These services are most often found in cities because that is where people live densely enough to make these sharing services viable.</p>\n\n<p>In a lot of ways The Sharing Economy is then really just The Urban Economy.  And the Urban Economy works pretty well.  Urban dwellers tend to not only be economically more efficient - getting more out of the stuff around them - they are also more energy efficient.  They are also probably happier.  A lot of research has shown that physical things rarely lead to a sustained feeling of satisfaction of happiness.  Experiences, on the other hand, can make us happier.  Experiences like a good restaurant meal, a memorable concert, or maybe even the sight of nicely folded laundry.</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id= \"minnesota_2013\">\n\n <h3>Getting Around in Minnesota</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"bikeMN.jpg\"> </p>\n<p> \nI was in Minnesota over Christmas, visiting my family.  This was my first time back in Minnesota in two years, and not coincidentally the first time I had driven in two years.  And I did a lot of driving.  A combination of staying in suburbs designed around cars and temperatures that dipped to 20 degrees below zero celsius made driving a necessity.  But there were signs that even here, transportation choice was improving.\n</p>\n\n<p> I stayed with my mom in Rosemount - just south of Minneapolis.  One surprising addition to the street-scape since the last time I was there was the addition of bike lanes and bike-route signage.  No one was using them in the 20-below temperatures, nor were they plowed even if a brave sole did venture out.  Still, they appeared plenty wide enough and were well marked.  Most people who live in the area have cars, but maybe they could inspire people to occasionally use a bike to get around.  In any case, I like the effort. \n</p>\n\n<p> \nIn the short run, what might have the bigger effect is the addition of a new Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line running from the southern suburbs and connecting with Minneapolis' light rail line.  The idea behind these lines is to mimic the regularity and transparency of a light rail line but using the existing street infrastructure.  The specially designed busses run at regular and frequent intervals - a schedule is not needed.  Even the stations are meant to mimic typical light rail stations.  This is a big improvement over the previous bus service to the area.  I tried once to use the local bus service to get from airport to the southern suburbs and it involved several transfers and a lot of waiting.  \n</p>\n\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"Academic_Nonsense_1\"> \n\n<h3>Academic Nonsense, Part 1: The Royal We and Magic Research</h3>\n<p> \nI was recently asked to write a short executive summary of some of my research for the program that funds my post-doctor position.  I dutifully complied, and even enjoyed trying to boil down my work and findings to a few, easy-to-understand paragraphs.  For the most part, the program leaders were happy with the results - except for one thing: they found it wrong that I kept on saying 'I' in my report.  I have heard it before: 'I' sounds to personal.  Research is supposed to be impersonal, objective, pure!  'I' gives the dangerous impression that there is an actual, fallable human behind this grand scholarship.  This is of course nonsense and leads to a lot of bad, hard-to-read writing, and perhaps worse, bad research.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nOne odd tradition many academics have taken in order to try to eliminate the 'I' from research writing is to substitute in 'we'.  This of course is quite natural when two or more authors write together.  But I always find it strange when single-authored papers insist on using the 'we'.  In the English language, little amiguity exists for when to use 'I' and 'we'; 'I' is for singular, 'we' is for plural.  Why do some academics feel the need to diverge from basic grammer?  Nearly all of my papers so far have been single authored. I have received plenty of feedback and advice along the way, but in the end, I take sole ownership and, more importantly, responsibility for what I do and write.  Using 'I' is an honest indication of that. \n</p>\n\n<p>Switching 'we' for 'I' in single-authored papers is a bit strange, but it doesn't really impact the readability and clearity of the prose.  A worse sin is when authors try to make their writing sound more 'objective' or 'academic' by getting rid of the personal pronoun all-together.  Instead of writing 'I show that x y z', you might see something like 'the research shows that x y z', or even worse, the passive 'it is shown that.'  This type of writing is wrong and bad at many different levels.  First and most importantly it leads to passive, hard-to-understand prose.  When you give passive objects the magical ability to act ('research shows') it can quickly lead to ambiguity.  Using a passive voice ('It is shown') leads to ambiguity on what 'it' is and the structure of passive sentences often becomes unweildy.  Finally, by eliminating the personal pronoun, the researcher is not being honest.  Research, like any other craft, involves trade-offs and decisions.  A researcher needs to be humble about the imperfections and ambiguity of their work and honest about the decisions and trade-offs they made.  A failure to do this can lead to both bad writing as well as sloppy thinking.  Good research does not benefit from either.</p>\n\n\n<p>p.s. One place where it is appropriate for a single author to use 'we' is where he is including the reader:  \"We can see in the table that x y z\"</p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"privatize_parking\"> \n<h3>Privatize Parking</h3>\n\n<p>Some goods and services are not well handled by free markets.  Providing health care is one place where markets can often fail - all sorts of ethical and informational factors get in the way of a well functioning market.  Parking, on the other hand. is not one of these goods.  But strangely, it is often treated as one - leading to a lot of frustration and waste.  Smart city planners should treat parking like the private, excludable good it is, at the same time they should question whether massive amounts of parking in crowded cities really is the best use of valuable space.</p>\n\n<p>Oslo recently announced that it would take steps to start charging for use of around half of the cities 18,000 free parking spaces.  This anouncement came after pilot projects in certain areas of the cities had shown that introducing payed parking was hugely popular - even among car owners.  Where locals previously had to spend hours every week trolling through their neighborhood looking for a open parking space, after the introduction of payed parking, finding parking suddenly became massively easier.  Given the relatively modest price of  theparking permits, most motorists found this to be a fantastic trade-off.\n</p>\n\n<p>  \nYet Oslo's actions, while a good start, are not nearly good enough.  First, there is still the case of the remaining thousands of free parking spaces.  More importantly, in a city where street parking takes up a large part of the public urban space, little emphasis has been given to the alternative use of this space.\nCompared to its Nordic capital-city neighbors like Copenhagen and Stockholm - Oslo has done an awful job of making the city bicycle-friendly.  Removing just a thousand strategically placed parking spaces would free up space for an interconnected bicycle infrastructure that Oslo sorely needs.  Another thousand would give space to wider sidewalks, more trees, perhaps even small playgrounds or expanded parks.  Planners need to start seeing the parking also in terms of opportunity cost - not just what drivers are willing to pay for parking but what also can that space be used for.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nRemoving parking spaces doesn't necessarily mean it will be harder to find parking either - but it will and should become more expensive.  Drivers who wish to use a street-level parking space should pay the going market price for it.  The best way for a city to ensure proper pricing would be to hand over control of the parking to either to a city-owned company or in the form of a long-term lease to a private company.  In turn these entities will operate the parking spaces and be in charge of setting an appropriate charge.  Arguably, such an entity would be able to have a form of local monopoly on street level parking - but they would have competition from private parking garages and people choosing to use busses, bikes and feet to get around.  Certainly not a bad thing.  \n</p>\n\n</article>\n\n\n\n\n<article id=\"distributed\">\n<h3>Renewable Redistribution</h3>\n\n<p>With development of effective and inexpensive solar and wind power technology, investing in energy projects has gone from being the exclusive domain of big utilites to anyone from a farmer to a suburban house owner.  Over the last couple of weeks, I have heard several interesting presentations that explore the actions of these new small-time energy investors. </p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"subsidies_competition\">wrote a few weeks ago</a>  about the idea from Matti Liski from Aalto University in Finland that subsidies for renewable energy investment might make energy markets more competitive by encouraging new entrants - leading to lower prices for consumers and lower profits for big utilities.  Loss-making utilities in Europe - hit by low electricity prices made this idea seem entirely sensible.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cicero.uio.no/employees/homepage.aspx?person_id=1510&lang=EN\">Kristin Linnerud</a>from the Norwegian Center for Environmental and Climate Research (CICERO) and some colleagues have asked another interesting question - how do these new small investors behave?  In a paper currently out for review, she finds that small, inexperienced investors tend to be quicker to invest and require lower returns.  She explains this with a reference to the psychology and behavioral economics litterature - humans often make simplifying rule-of-thumb decisions under complex situations.  A norwegian farmer looking at investing in a small run-of-the-river plant will tend to evaluate if it is likely to make money or not rather than more complex calculations involving potential risk. </p>\n\n<p> Another interesting presentation was by Xiaozi Liu, currently of Greenpeace International.  She presented an overview at NHH about crowdsourcing of renewable energy projects.  The idea here is that companies would solicit individuals to fund portions of a renewable energy project.  A company operating in the US is already operating by that model - building and funding solar power plants and allowing individuals to invest relatively small amounts in return for the proceeds.  An interesting idea that came up during the discussion was that individuals might be willing to fund these type of projects with a lower expected return.  Crowdsourcing might then be a way of reducing the financing costs of solar and other \"green\" energy investments</p>\n\n<p> The cost of wind and especially solar power equipment has dropped drastically over the last few years.  <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2013-12-nrel-soft-largest-piece-solar.html\">Solar panel cells</a> now account for a mere 20-30 percent of the total cost of a given installation.  Reducing costs in other areas, especially financing, is then increasingly important and there seems to be ample room for being optimistic that here to costs can come down further. </p> \n\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"half-assed\">\n<h3>The Beauty of a Half-Assed Job</h3>\n<p>\nWhen I lived in New York City between 2004 to 2006, the thought of using a bicycle to get around didn't enter my mind.  Roads were for cars, and only half-crazed bicycle messengers dared get around on two-wheels.  But in the seven years that have passed New York has made astonishing strides in making the city both more bicycle friendly as well as more pedestrian friendly.  This was done, essentially with a philosophy of doing a quick, half-assed job while leaving more permanent solutions and requisite planning for the long term.  Other cities struggling to implement ambitious cycling and pedestrian goals could learn from this approach.</p> \n\n<p> The transportation commissioner of New York under Michael Bloomberg, Janette Sadik Khan, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LujWrkYsl64\">explains</a> how the city got results fast by using temporary solutions.  Times Square was transformed in a matter of weeks into a true pedestrian plaza by using paint, planters, and even lawn chairs.  Protected bike lanes were created by moving car parking about a meter from the curb and splashing some green paint on the road.  By using inexpensive and temporary solutions, the city could both test how well these solutions worked before deciding on permanent solutions as well as making permanent solutions politically feasible.  </p>\n\n<p> Here in Norway, the two largest cities - Oslo and Bergen - have had plans for creating interconnected bicycling networks for decades, but progress is depressingly slow.  Bike paths are created a few kilometers at a time, if at all.  The result is a patchwork of bike lanes and bike paths that can come to halt without warning.  Bicyclists are forced onto sidwalks - annoying pedestrians - or out into traffic - annoying drivers and endangering bicyclists.  Planners and politicians have been known to excuse the slow progress by pointing out how little space there is in these urban centers.  The dubious logic of prioritizing cars when space is tight does not seem to have dawned on them.  </p>\n\n<p> Norwegian politicians and planners should learn from New York's example.  Use quick and temporary sollutions in trial periods and then gather as much data as possible.  Leave the complicated planning and long-term solutions for another day.  The politicians and planners will likely find that controversial bike lanes, reduced parking, and lower speed limits suddenly become less controversial as people experience their benefits.   \n</p> \n\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"bybane_tunnel\"> \n<h3>The Bergen Light Rail Debate: No Light at the End of the Tunnel </h3>\n\n<p> A big decision was made for the future of Bergen yesterday.  The members of the local conservative party held an internal vote on whether an extension of the light rail line that will cross the city center and continue northwards should be built at street level across the historic “Bryggen” (wharf) or should be put in a tunnel.  A large majority in the party voted for the tunnel option. This matters because the other parties in the city council are approximately evenly split on the issue, and so the final decision comes down to votes from the conservative party.  If the tunnel option ultimately gets the go-ahead, it will likely serve to be a costly mistake and an example of populist and misguided politics trumping good city planning.  </p>\n\n<p> Most of the debate has centered around the effect of the light rail on the UNESCO-listed Bryggen.  The most extreme of the tunnel-advocates claim that the light rail line will ruin Bryggen.  Considering that a heavily trafficked four-laned road currently runs where the light-rail would go, this is clearly bluster.  The exhaust, noise and danger of over 10,000 cars and busses passing per day is an order of magnitude more damaging than 100 electric light-rail crossings.  While tunnel advocates have dangled the possibility for a vehicle free Bryggen, none have committed to a timeline for doing so.  The only concrete plans for making Bryggen car-free comes from putting a light-rail line there.  Without the light-rail line, much of the political capital for removing cars from Bryggen also disappears.  </p>\n\n<p>But the debate over the tunnel options has much wider, and arguably more important implications than just the status of Bryggen.  A tunnel in the center of the city would also mean a tunnel along a long stretch northward as well.  On the other hand, a light-rail line over bryggen would continue along what is now a heavily trafficked highway.  Currently this highway is the source of much noise and air pollution, and has the effect of bisecting the northern neighborhoods of Bergen.  With the light rail line at street-level, this traffic would be diverted to a tunnel and ring roads - eliminating much noise and pollution.   </p>\n\n<p> More so, experience from the existing light-rail line is that high-density developments spring up along the route.  People want to live close to the light rail.  No one wants to live close to a highway.  By choosing a tunnel option, the city would be turning its back on a once in a century opportunity to revitalize and improve a large swath of Bergen.  </p>\n\n<p> Finally, as the perpetually delayed and over-budget subways in Rome and the east side of Manhattan show, building tunnels in dense city centers can be a complicated and messy undertaking.  Some estimates already put the tunnel option at costing 2.5 billion kroners more than a street-level route, and it will, even in the best circumstances, add several years to the construction and planning.  Yet, history says that with such a complex project, even the best made plans can go awry.  In hindsight, members of the conservative party may come to regret voting for what has the potential to become a major boondoggle for Bergen. </p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"stockholm_bike_pics\"> \n<h3>Space for Bikes and Cars in Stockholm</h3>\n<p>\nIt is a typically grim, gray and drizzly November in Stockholm, but there are still plenty of people getting around on their bikes.  The postal service in Stockholm is an enthusiastic user of utility bikes to deliver the mail.  They are easy to get around in and they never have a problem finding parking - which they need to do several hundred times over the course of a day.  Technology is now making it even easier for these efficient post(wo)men.  The picture below is of a post-bike with an electric assist, the first time I have seen that.  \n</p>\n<img src=\"post_bike.jpg\">\n\n<p>\nThe drivers of the two expensive automobiles below have un-intentionally made en excellent visual point about the use and abuse of valuable city space.  They have parked in front of a city-bicycle stand - though the bikes are missing since the system closes down for the winter in November.  I counted 14 bicycle parking spaces along the length of these two cars.  \n</p>\n<img src=\"car_space.jpg\">\n\n<p>\nOn a related note, the Stockholm city and Swedish national government recently made big news by announcing an agreement on a major extension of the cities subway system.  I'm usually for increased investment in public transit, but I am skeptical.  Subways are extremely expensive and slow to build.  More so, Stockholm has obscene amounts of on-street parking and many French-style wide-avenues.  A much more cost effective and quick solution would be to build a light-rail system on existing surface streets.  The cost in space would mainly be in terms of parking for Land Rovers and BMW's.  \n</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<article id=\"subsidies_competition\">\n<h3>Renewable Subsidies and Competition in Electricity</h3>\n<p>Today I listened to a presentation of a theoretical paper and, to my surprise, I found it interesting.  The paper was by Matti Liski from Aalto University in Finland and a working paper can be found <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/ceepr/www/publications/workingpapers/2010-005.pdf\">here</a>.  But the idea is quite simple.  Traditionally it has been hard to get started as an electricity company - there are high barriers to entry.  Liski mentioned the uncertainty of future fuel costs as one barrier to entry, but I would guess financing and operating a large coal, gas or nuclear plant as an equally if not more important factor.  With high barriers to entry that means little competition in supply and in turn higher prices for consumers.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of the paper is then to suggest that subsidies of renewable energy may, on the whole, not be that costly for society.  The reason is that while subsidies may be expensive, they encourage new entrants in electricity markets which lead to a more competitive market and lower prices.  Consumers pay for subsidies, but they also reap the rewards of lower overall prices.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons I like this paper is that it gels nicely with many of the stories coming out of the electricity sector at the moment.  Big electricity companies complain that they no longer are able to make reliable profits, and several have racked up big losses over the last couple of years.  Many clearly resent the subsidies and regulations that are eroding their market power.  Just one example was a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-12/tea-party-s-green-faction-fights-for-solar-in-red-states.html\">recent story in Bloomberg News</a> about Tea Party advocates and Green advocates teaming up against the local electricity monopoly to support solar power.</p>\n\n<p>The large-scale introduction of renewables into electricity markets is leading to many surprising outcomes</p>\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"privatizing_roads_germany\"> \n    <h3>Privatize The Roads, German Edition</h3>\n    <p>Some months ago  <a href=\"http://thinkingsimplemindedly.blogspot.se/2013/08/privatize-the-raods.html\">I wrote earlier in this blog</a> that politicians should and probably would begin charging for use of roads.  I saw in the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f8a408c-4561-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jo8ARhMT\">financial times today</a> that Germany is doing just that... for foreigners.  Well, officially everyone has to pay the fee for the use of the autobahn, but residents will appparently get the money back as a tax rebate as they have already paid for it in their road tax.  A substantial percentage of Germans do not drive and I wonder if making this implicit fee explicit will have political consequences - like a true pay-to-use system - toll roads, etc. </p>\n\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"The_Electric_Car_in_Norway\">\n    <h3>The Electric Car in Norway:Fully Charged</h3>\n<p> The buzz around the corridors of my workplace has recently been about sports cars.  Perhaps not that surprising given the number of men in their 50s who work in my department.  But one car in particular, the Tesla Model S, is generating most of the buzz.  I know of two who have already placed orders and I wouldn’t be surprised if more followed.  The Tesla is a big, fast and expensive sports car.  But it is also fully electric and so it gets the label of “green” and benefits from some generous Norwegian government incentives.</p>  \n\n <p>Getting people to switch from gasoline and diesel cars to electric is probably, on the whole, a good thing.  But heavily subsidizing sports cars for the well-off has its obvious problems.  The point of the heavy subsidies was to kick-start the market for electrics.  In Norway, that has been largely accomplished. The Government should, and likely will begin to roll-back the incentives. </p> \n\n <p>The incentives for purchasing an electrical vehicles in Norway may be the most generous in the world.  Electric car buyers avoid the hefty taxes and fees that will typically double the price of a car.  In addition electric car drivers avoid road tolls and even get free passage on ferries.  And then there is the fuel cost - Norway has some of the highest gasoline and diesel prices in the world, but electricity prices are moderate. More so, free charging is available in many locations.</p>  \n\n <p>Back when electric cars were little more than supercharged golf carts from small producers such as Reva and Think!, these generous incentives led a few early-adaptors to start zipping around Norway’s cities.  But now that major manufacturers have begun making electric cars that are similar in size and utility to normal gas-powered cars, sales have taken off.  The electric Nissan Leaf has been one of the best-selling cars in Norway in the last year - just behind VW’s Golf.  Now that the Tesla has gone on sale, it has also become one of the most sold cars in Norway. </p>\n\n <p>Electric cars have a solid foothold in Norway, and the infrastructure for them - like charging stations - are spreading quickly.  But that means that much of the reasoning for subsidies is also disappearing. Electric cars are not good for the environment, despite what their manufacturers might want you to believe.  They are only less bad for the environment than their gas or diesel sipping peers.  They still create congestion on roads and in dense city centres.  They pose a danger to pedestrians and cyclists - maybe even more than noisier petrol cars.  And they cause emissions, though indirectly through the electricity they consume. </p> \n\n<p>There is also the issue of fairness.  A wealthy individual looking to buy a second, electric car can skip import and value-added taxes.  A student looking to buy a bicycle gets no such help.  More so, if the government’s aim is to reduce pollution and improve the environment they would likely get much more bang for their buck by investing in better public transport and bicycling infrastructure.  </p>\n</article>\n\n<article id=\"silver_lining_price_spikes\">\n    <h3>The Silver Lining of Price Spikes</h3>\n<p>I recently put out a NHH discussion paper titled “The Silver Lining of Price Spikes: How price spikes can help overcome the energy efficiency gap.”  As the title suggests, the research question revolves around what is alternatively called the energy efficiency gap or paradox, which is the observation that consumers and businesses do not always invest in energy efficiency even when the returns to doing so appear to be ample. </p> \n\n<p> The inspiration for the article came from my earlier master student Louis Pauchon who wrote a master thesis comparing energy efficiency policies in both Norway and France.  A central part of his argument was that efforts to improve energy efficiency were more successful in Norway compared to France because of the greater variability of prices in Norway.  He presented a chart showing a correlation between heat pump installations and seasonal variation in prices.  I suggested that he also look to see if there were a correlation between electricity prices and google searches for heat pumps in Norway.  He produced a chart that appeared to show just that. </p>\n\n<p> My paper narrows in on the informational role that price spikes might play.  I also use data on google searches and prices in Norway as well as a few other time series.  I argue that price spikes, by creating attention around prices and energy efficiency, can serve a useful role. </p> \n\n<p> To support my argument I first needed to define a price spike - something that is harder in practice than it might first appear.  No generally recognised definition of a price spike exists.  I skirted around the issue - defining a range of price spikes.  Essentially I first smoothed the prices to various degrees, and then calculated deviations from these smoothed curves. </p> \n\n<p> I then ran regressions to see if I could say with confidence that there really was a correlation between price spikes and searches for heat pumps.  The results indicated that there was good reason to believe that a strong correlation exists between price spikes and searches for heat pumps no matter how narrowly I defined price spikes.</p>  \n\n<p> The question then remains whether it is correct to give this correlation the interpretation of it being a causal informational affect.  First, the correlations could simply reflect that demand for heat pumps go up when prices go up - a conclusion hardly worth a research paper. </p>\n\n<p> To deal with this I included the smoothed terms in the regressions and argued that this should capture the price-demand effect since consumers essentially pay a smoothed price - at a minimum a monthly average.  More so, as I narrow the definition of price spikes, then the estimated effect on the deviations effect should decrease if only the price-demand effect was at play.  But the opposite appears to happen - the estimated effect actually tended to become bigger the more narrowly price spikes were defined. </p> \n\n<p>This was what I would consider a fun paper to write.  The methods and conclusions were all relatively simple, but the point that emerges has - as far as I know - not been discussed in the literature.  It is not clear to me if there are any important policy implications from this research.  If I were forced to point to something it might be for politicians and policymakers to be a bit more relaxed about price spikes.  The news and media attention that they generate - while uncomfortable for politicians - may be good for an energy efficient society.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article> <a href=\"http://thinkingsimplemindedly.blogspot.com\">Archive of older posts</a></p></article><p>\n\n</section>",
